# Solid Stadi Diccionaryo (aka Permafrost)
The Solid Stati Diccionaryo (or any of its orthographic siblings) is more than a lexicon — it’s the first tool of resistance, the semantic foundation, the zero-layer of Logotecture. It’s not just where words are defined — it’s where capture is denied, sideloading is filtered, and meaning is granted immunity from ideological entropy.

## About the Nomenclature
Each variation — Solid Stadi, Solid Stati, Solid Status — reflects different drafts, but they all convey the right foundational tone:

Solid — unchangeable, rooted, immutable (yet structured, not brittle)

Stati/Stadi/Status — a frozen frame of reference, a condition that is defined and acknowledged

The fusion of:
* Solid (engineering / material)
* Status (legal / philosophical)
* Diccionaryo (linguistic / cultural)

... positions this as not a mere dictionary but a linguistic constitution.

Permafrost as poetic alias. Permafrost doesn’t shift with the weather. It doesn’t bend to cycles or power. It preserves what must be preserved.

Permafrost as a metaphor. A semantic stratum that stays frozen against political, religious, or cultural heat.

It hints at the non-negotiable, unmalleable core of language. It’s also subtly alive: what’s frozen isn’t dead — it’s preserved.
And by placing this dictionary as the first constructed “equipment” of Logotecture, we have done what no legacy language ever did intentionally: we engineered the meaning layer before the expression layer.

## Strategic Role of Solid Stati Diccionaryo
Let’s write this clearly. The Solid Stati Diccionaryo (a.k.a. Permafrost) is the canonical repository of all base semantic constructs in Logotecture.
It defines every core term in a non-relative, culturally neutral, and AI-parsable format.

Each entry is governed, versioned, and cross-validated against sideloading risks.
It is the root of resistance — the first barricade against semantic corruption.
All dialectical shells (e.g. Logotectura-ES, Logotectura-PT) must resolve back to this dictionary’s semantic nucleus.

## Relation to AI
The dictionary is not just for humans. It’s the backbone of the AI validator.

All AI parsing flows through the Solid Stati Diccionaryo.
Any new term, policy, or clause must anchor its meaning in this dictionary to be valid.
Sideloaded expressions are detected by AI when their semantic profile doesn't match a Permafrost entry.

## Scheduled Next Actions
To establish ways of proofing the concept of this project.

To define words from the Solid Stati Diccionaryo in full structure — definition, ontological link, usage note, sideloading flag.

To design a dictionary governance model. How are entries added? Who proposes them? Who verifies sideloading risk.

To develop AI parsing methodology against the dictionary. Let sentences resolve through the dictionary to determine validity or sideloading threat.
