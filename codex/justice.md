### 🔍 Core Principles

- **Fairness**: Equal treatment without bias or favoritism; distribution of consequences must be proportional and appropriate to actions  
- **Equity**: Not mere equality, but ensuring **all agents are treated based on their specific needs, conditions, and context**  
- **Accountability**: Agents must be held responsible for their actions, with consequences that reflect their violation of obligations or the harm they caused  
- **Restoration**: Justice seeks to restore balance — to rectify harm and ensure the wronged party is restored to a fair position within the system

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Revenge or retribution**: Justice **does not** serve as an avenue for punishing for the sake of punishment; it aims for balance and **restoration of fairness**  
- **Bias or discrimination**: Justice **cannot** be served through unequal application based on personal beliefs, race, class, or any other non-relevant variable  
- **Vengeance or mob justice**: Justice operates through defined **legal** or **systemic** processes, not through emotional, impulsive actions

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High — **Justice** is highly susceptible to ideological misuse, especially when invoked to justify **power imbalances** or **personal agendas**.

Invalid examples:
- “We must seek justice at all costs” → **must be specified** through legal, systemic, and measurable outcomes  
- “This is justice for the people” → must be supported by **clear procedures**, **impartiality**, and **fair treatment for all parties**  
- “The justice system is broken” → requires **scoped definition of fairness, equality**, and **accountability mechanisms** in the system

### 🔁 Variants

- `justice.legal`: justice as applied in formal legal frameworks, involving courts, trials, and statutory laws  
- `justice.restorative`: focusing on repairing harm and restoring balance rather than retribution  
- `justice.retributive`: emphasizing punishment or consequence for actions, though still bound by **proportionality** and **systemic fairness**  
- `justice.social`: justice related to the **distribution of power** and **resources** within a community, ensuring equity for all members

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- Justice **requires verification** — it is not an idealistic concept, but a procedural outcome that must be demonstrable through evidence, proportionality, and audit  
- Every claim of justice must be linked to **specific, transparent procedures** within the system, whether legal, contractual, or procedural  
- **Restorative justice** mechanisms should be prioritized where possible to reduce systemic harm and promote rehabilitation over punishment
