### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
Ethics is one of the most **misused terms**, often distorted to serve the interests of powerful entities or cultural norms that mask **unjust** or **exploitative** behaviors. In Logotecture, **ethical reasoning** is bound by **semantic clarity**, ensuring that **semantic capture** cannot reframe ethical discussions to protect the powerful.

Examples:
- **Misleading Ethics**: Ethical claims that obscure harm or injustice to protect vested interests, e.g., justifying inequality with ‚Äúethical traditions.‚Äù
- **Ethical Dissonance**: Actions or policies that violate fundamental ethical principles while claiming ethical standing, e.g., **ethics-washing** by corporations or governments.

### üîê Governance Notes

- Without ethics, systems collapse into **might-makes-right** logic, where the powerful get to define **good** and **just**.  
- In Logotecture, **ethics** is what keeps systems **functional, just, and resistant to capture** by opportunistic powers.
