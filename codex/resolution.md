# Term: resolution

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
A **resolution** is a **terminative or transformative act** that brings a **problematic state**‚Äîsuch as contradiction, uncertainty, dispute, or failure‚Äîinto a **recognized, acceptable, and structurally compatible form**, with **defined outcomes, traceable rationale, and zero lingering semantic ambiguity**.

**Domain**: logic, governance, legal systems, language infrastructure, AI decision processes  
**Forms**: resolution (n), resolve (v), resolvable (adj), resolved (adj)

**Depends on**:  
- **contradiction@1.0.0**  
- **ambiguity@1.0.0**  
- **decision@1.0.0**  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **coherence@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Target-Oriented**: Every resolution aims at **eliminating or transforming a conflict** or incoherence.

- **Procedure-Governed**: Resolutions follow **known logic or process paths**, not arbitrary imposition.

- **Outcome-Explicit**: A resolution must **state its effects and consequences** in usable form.

- **Traceable Reasoning**: Each resolution must declare the **rationale and criteria** behind it.

---

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Resolution ‚â† Compromise**: While some resolutions involve balance, they are not necessarily midpoint agreements.

- **Resolution ‚â† Suppression**: Ignoring, deferring, or silencing a contradiction **is not resolution**.

- **Resolution ‚â† Agreement**: A resolution may be **decisive without consensus**, provided it follows the rule-structure.

---

### üîÅ Variants

- `resolution.legal`: Settling legal ambiguity, contradiction, or overlapping jurisdiction.

- `resolution.logical`: Making mutually exclusive propositions structurally coherent or dismissing invalid forms.

- `resolution.semantic`: Disambiguating conflicting meanings within term definitions or usage.

- `resolution.operational`: Fixing or halting conflicting system states or unresolvable command inputs.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**Moderate**, especially when power asymmetry lets entities **claim resolution without process or legitimacy**.

- **Authoritative Masking**: Powerful groups may label something as ‚Äúresolved‚Äù to **avoid scrutiny**.

- **Surface Fixes**: Resolutions that change form but **not the cause** may misrepresent closure.

- **Overresolution**: Excessive resolution can **eliminate useful complexity or diversity**.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Resolution Protocol**: Each domain (legal, semantic, operational) must declare **authorized resolution paths**.

- **Rollback Flag**: Resolutions must include **reversibility logic** when contexts shift.

- **Multi-Party Auditability**: Resolution records must be **auditable and challengeable**.

- **Minimal Bias Tolerance**: In semantic contexts, resolution should reflect **truthfulness, not dominance**.

---

### üåç Why This Matters in Practice

- **Judicial Integrity**: Societal systems must resolve‚Äînot perpetuate‚Äîlegal contradictions to uphold justice.

- **AI Decisiveness**: Autonomous systems must resolve ambiguity **before acting**, not post hoc.

- **Language Health**: Public discourse collapses when **ambiguities or contradictions persist unresolved**.

- **Conflict De-escalation**: Resolution mechanisms offer **peaceful transitions out of structural tension**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è In Logotecture

- **Resolution is a System Node**: All contradictions must be **traceably linked to resolution objects**, or remain flagged.

- **Resolution Chains**: One resolution may **trigger downstream adjustments**; chaining is allowed but must not fragment logic.

- **Community Challenges**: Any resolution may be **challenged and re-processed** via participatory mechanisms.

- **AI-Assist Ready**: Language parsing and contradiction resolution **must be AI-visible, testable, and interpretable**.
