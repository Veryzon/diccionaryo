# Term: exploitability

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Exploitability** is the degree to which a known or latent vulnerability within a semantic, structural, legal, or informational system can be **leveraged**, **activated**, or **weaponized** by an internal or external agent for **unintended control**, **distortion**, or **evasion**. In Logotecture, exploitability determines the **urgency of mitigation** and **priority of patching**.

**Domain**: risk modeling, semantic governance, cybersecurity, epistemology, law  
**Forms**: exploitability (noun), exploitable (adj), exploit (verb), exploited (adj), exploiter (agent)

**Depends on**:  
- **vulnerability@1.0.0**  
- **intent@1.0.0**  
- **access@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Probability + Impact**: Measures how likely an actor is to discover and use a weakness, and how significant the outcome may be.

- **Agency-Activated**: Exploitability requires a potential **actor** (human, institutional, or machine) with **means** and **motive**.

- **Semantic Leverage Point**: Often occurs at **undefined**, **ambiguous**, or **conflicting** terms where alternative interpretations can be inserted.

- **Multiplicative Risk**: A single exploit path may lead to **redefinition cascades**, **legal loopholes**, or **automated misapplication** at scale.

---

### üöß Exclusions

- **Known Weaknesses with Controls**: A vulnerability that‚Äôs well-documented, monitored, and guarded is less likely exploitable.

- **Hypothetical Abuse**: Theoretical manipulation without plausible access or context does not elevate to active exploitability.

- **Internal Error without Leverage**: Misunderstandings or mistakes that don‚Äôt lead to distortion or abuse are not exploits.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Critical.  
Exploitability is the primary **activation path** for **semantic sideloading**, **legal capture**, and **AI misguidance**.

Examples:
- Ambiguous legal term used by powerful actors to exclude entire classes of people from protections.  
- Poorly defined AI ethics clause exploited to justify biased outputs under plausible deniability.  
- Hidden recursion in contract language interpreted to mean the opposite of its stated intent.

### üîÅ Variants

- `exploitability.semantic`: Risk of a term or structure being reinterpreted or redirected for **ideological**, **commercial**, or **legal** gain.

- `exploitability.legal`: Degree to which ambiguous or loosely worded law enables **selective enforcement**, **loopholes**, or **immunity**.

- `exploitability.operational`: Exposure to misuse due to **structural misalignment**, **absence of safeguards**, or **nonstandard implementation**.

- `exploitability.automated`: Exploitability of logic or language when interpreted by **machine systems**, especially in AI/LLMs.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Patch Priority**: High exploitability triggers immediate **semantic lock**, audit, and either **refinement** or **redesign**.

- **Exploit Reports**: Public or private exploit reports must be registered in **traceable logs** with severity tags.

- **Actor-Aware Modeling**: Exploitability is evaluated in relation to known or plausible actors (e.g., governments, corporations, AIs, NGOs).

- **AI Defense Alignment**: AI agents must be trained to detect and flag exploitable patterns in interpretation, application, or contribution.
