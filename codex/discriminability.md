# Term: discriminability

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Discriminability** is the property of a concept, signal, or structure that allows it to be clearly and reliably **distinguished** from other, potentially similar elements within a shared system of interpretation. In Logotecture, discriminability is essential for maintaining **semantic clarity**, **identity separation**, and **functional unambiguity**—especially in systems that must be **parsed**, **verified**, or **enforced** by humans or machines.

**Domain**: semiotics, systems theory, linguistics, design, cognition  
**Forms**: discriminability (noun), discriminable (adj), discriminate (verb)

**Depends on**:  
- **recognizability@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **coherence@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Contrastive Form**: Discriminability requires that terms or units possess **sufficient contrast** in form (visual, acoustic, structural, semantic) to avoid being confused with others.

- **Bounded Similarity**: Similar items must remain **non-overlapping** in their essential function or domain; high discriminability tolerates **analogy** but resists **conflation**.

- **Contextual Sensitivity**: What is discriminable in one context (e.g., legal language) may not be in another (e.g., spoken vernacular); Logotecture aims for **system-wide consistency**.

- **Operational Separability**: Systems should treat discriminable terms or structures as **distinct**—no two entries should perform the **same semantic or functional role** unless explicitly aliased.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Stylistic Variants**: Differences in **aesthetic or accent** do not create meaningful discriminability unless they alter function or semantic load.

- **False Separation**: Creating multiple terms for the **same functional object** without meaningful distinction creates noise, not clarity.

- **Implicit Clustering**: Overlapping or vaguely defined categories undermine discriminability by allowing **multiple interpretations** of the same symbol or signal.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Discriminability breakdown allows **semantic deception**—for example, injecting terms that **mimic the sound or look** of legitimate ones to introduce **false concepts**, **stealthy authority**, or **legal ambiguity**.

Invalid examples:
- “Trust and trustworthiness are different because they feel different” → If no **functional or definitional separation** exists, the distinction is invalid.
- “Two institutions with nearly identical names but different agendas” → High sideloading potential if no formal disambiguation is enforced.

### 🔁 Variants

- `discriminability.semantic`: Clarity of meaning that allows a concept to be distinguished from other, adjacent concepts—essential for **vocabulary discipline**.

- `discriminability.visual`: Design features that make icons, symbols, or structures easily distinguishable, especially in UI, legal documents, or signage.

- `discriminability.legal`: Separation of legal terms, rights, statuses, or authorities to prevent jurisdictional or procedural confusion.

- `discriminability.technical`: In software or protocol design, ensures that commands, messages, or behaviors are uniquely and unambiguously identified.

- `discriminability.identity`: The distinctiveness between persons, organizations, or roles that prevents **identity fraud**, **role confusion**, or **impersonation**.

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Controlled Vocabulary**: All entries in Logotecture must maintain **formal separability**. If two terms cannot be discriminated in usage or logic, they must be merged or explicitly aliased.

- **Definition Collisions**: Proposed new terms must undergo **collision testing** against existing ones to ensure clear separation and avoid **semantic convergence**.

- **AI Parsing Dependence**: Discriminability is essential for automated parsing, reasoning, and enforcement. Ambiguity here leads to **systemic failure** in AI mediation.

- **Contextual Documentation**: Every term should carry **notes on differentiators**—what makes it unique, and what concepts it is easily confused with.
