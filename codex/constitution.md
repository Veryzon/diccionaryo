### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Supreme Law**: A **constitution** is the highest legal authority in a state. All laws, policies, and governmental actions must conform to the **constitution**. It often includes a system of **checks and balances** to prevent the abuse of power.
- **Framework of Governance**: The **constitution** outlines the basic structure of government, including the allocation of powers between branches of government (e.g., executive, legislative, judicial) and the relationship between the state and its citizens.
- **Protection of Rights**: A core feature of most constitutions is the **protection of individual rights** and freedoms, which can include **freedom of speech**, **religion**, **assembly**, and **due process** under the law.
- **Stability and Continuity**: The **constitution** provides long-term **stability** by establishing clear and enduring principles, making it difficult for temporary political shifts or majorities to alter fundamental rights or the structure of government.
- **Amendability**: While a **constitution** provides stability, it is typically designed with provisions for amendments, allowing it to adapt to changing circumstances, evolving societal values, and new legal developments.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Unconstitutional Acts**: Any actions, laws, or policies that violate the **constitution** are considered **unconstitutional**. A key role of courts, especially **constitutional courts**, is to interpret and rule on whether laws or actions comply with the **constitution**.
- **Injustice**: A **constitution** that enshrines discriminatory practices, suppresses freedoms, or fails to protect the rights of all individuals is ineffective in serving its purpose of ensuring **justice** and **equality**.
- **Political Manipulation**: If a constitution is altered or ignored to serve the interests of a specific group or to consolidate power, it loses its integrity and legitimacy, undermining the **democratic** principles it is meant to uphold.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Moderate to High.  
- **Sideloading** of the **constitution** occurs when those in power manipulate its interpretation or the application of its principles to justify actions that are contrary to the spirit of the law. This can be done through **judicial reinterpretation**, **amendment**, or **deviation** from established norms.
- **Constitutional manipulation** happens when amendments or changes to the **constitution** are made to entrench the power of a ruling class, depriving citizens of their rights or altering the distribution of power in ways that violate core democratic principles.
- **Cultural sideloading** can also influence the application of **constitutional principles**, where interpretations are shaped by political ideologies, leaving room for **bias** or **partiality** in legal proceedings.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúA government proposes an **amendment to the constitution** that consolidates power in the hands of a single political leader, undermining democratic checks and balances‚Äù ‚Üí this would be an **unconstitutional** act that violates the principles of **separation of powers** and **representative governance**.
- ‚ÄúA constitution guarantees **freedom of speech**, but government-enforced **censorship laws** undermine this right‚Äù ‚Üí such a violation would go against the **constitutional** guarantee of **freedom of expression**.

### üîÅ Variants

- `constitution.national`: A **national constitution** defines the political and legal structure of a sovereign state, determining the rights of citizens, the functioning of government, and the relationship between the state and its people.
- `constitution.state`: A **state constitution** refers to the governing document of individual states or provinces within a nation, often defining the scope of state-level authority, rights, and powers that may be distinct from the national constitution.
- `constitution.local`: A **local constitution** governs the organization and authority of local government bodies, municipalities, or cities, typically addressing issues specific to the locality‚Äôs governance.
- `constitution.unwritten`: Some nations, such as the **United Kingdom**, rely on an **unwritten constitution**, based on statutes, precedents, and conventions, rather than a single formal written document.
- `constitution.supreme`: The **supreme constitution** refers to the highest-level constitutional framework that governs a country, often entrenching fundamental rights and setting the basic structure for the entire legal and political system.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Constitutional Legitimacy**: For a **constitution** to be effective, it must be seen as legitimate by the people it governs. This legitimacy stems from its ability to represent the will of the people and protect their **fundamental rights**.
- **Constitutional Courts**: In many countries, **constitutional courts** are established to rule on matters of **constitutionality**, ensuring that laws and governmental actions are aligned with the principles set out in the **constitution**.
- **Constitutional Amendments**: While a **constitution** must be adaptable to changing times, the process for amending a constitution is often rigorous, requiring broad **consensus** or **supermajorities** to prevent arbitrary or hasty changes that might undermine the **stability** of governance.
- **Citizen Participation**: A constitution should reflect the values and will of the **people**, and it is essential for citizens to have mechanisms to participate in **constitutional reform** or challenge actions that violate constitutional principles.
