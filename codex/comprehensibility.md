# Term: comprehensibility

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Comprehensibility** is the degree to which a message, system, term, or structure can be understood by its intended audience without distortion or excess cognitive load. In Logotecture, it is a **non-negotiable metric**: every word, rule, or concept must be **designed to be interpreted correctly**, avoiding ambiguity, overcomplexity, or hidden meaning.

**Domain**: linguistics, communication theory, cognitive science, governance, education  
**Forms**: comprehensibility (noun), comprehensible (adj), comprehend (verb), incomprehensible (antonym)

**Depends on**:  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **order@1.0.0**  
- **semantic transparency@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Accessibility of Meaning**: The user can **grasp the core message** without specialized interpretation or excessive inference.

- **Cognitive Alignment**: The structure of information matches how the human (or machine) **naturally processes logic, syntax, or symbols**.

- **Minimal Ambiguity**: Terms or structures are designed to **limit multiple conflicting interpretations** unless explicitly allowed.

- **Adaptability to Context**: While anchored, the content allows **understanding across reasonable linguistic or cultural variation**.

- **Error Tolerance**: Minor misunderstandings should not cause **complete breakdown** of meaning or function.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Expert-Only Language**: Systems that require specialized training to parse fail broad comprehensibility, even if they’re internally coherent.

- **Over-Formalism**: Rigid syntax or abstract phrasing may limit access to meaning, especially for lay users or cross-cultural readers.

- **Simplification Without Precision**: Comprehensibility does not mean **dumbing down**—clarity must be retained.

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Obfuscation through technicality, bureaucratic language, or abstraction is often **used deliberately to avoid accountability**.

Invalid examples:
- “The policy is written clearly.” → If the document uses legalese or circular definitions, it **prevents real comprehension**.
- “This term is widely used.” → Ubiquity ≠ comprehensibility; **repetition of unclear language** increases confusion, not clarity.

### 🔁 Variants

- `comprehensibility.linguistic`: Terms and phrases are **intelligible and grammatically transparent** to their readers.

- `comprehensibility.semantic`: The **intended meaning can be retrieved** by examining context and reference.

- `comprehensibility.procedural`: Instructions or legal rules can be **followed without contradiction or confusion**.

- `comprehensibility.structural`: The system's layout or logic is **navigable and explainable**, not a black box.

- `comprehensibility.machine`: Systems or languages are parseable by **AI or software agents** with a high success rate and low ambiguity margin.

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Design for Comprehensibility First**: Every artifact in Logotecture must **declare its readability layer**, audience, and access method.

- **Multimodal Expression**: Use supporting visuals, formatting, or parallel phrasing to enhance understanding—especially for global or cross-domain users.

- **Versioning Helps Understanding**: Logically evolving terms through traceable updates supports **learning and adaptation**.

- **Review Cycles Must Include Comprehension Testing**: If something cannot be clearly understood by its intended audience, **it should not be enforced**.
