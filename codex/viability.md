# Term: viability

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Viability** refers to the ability of a system, entity, or process to continue functioning and thriving over time, maintaining its essential characteristics and capabilities without external intervention or collapse. In broader contexts, **viability** speaks to the system's capacity to endure, adapt, and evolve in response to both external and internal challenges. A viable system is not only sustainable but also resilient to disruptions, ensuring it can continue to meet its goals and contribute to its environment or society in a meaningful way.

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Long-Term Survival**: **Viability** is fundamentally about the long-term survival of a system or entity. This means ensuring that the system can endure and continue to meet its needs, whether those needs are related to ecological balance, economic stability, social health, or organizational growth.

- **Adaptability and Flexibility**: A viable system can adjust and evolve in response to changing circumstances or challenges. This adaptability is crucial for survival in a world marked by uncertainty, climate change, shifting markets, or evolving social dynamics. The ability to pivot or reconfigure is a hallmark of **viability**.

- **Efficiency**: **Viability** is closely linked to the efficient use of available resources. A viable system maximizes the utility of its resources, whether human, natural, or financial, ensuring minimal waste and maximum output.

- **Resilience**: A viable system is not only capable of surviving under normal conditions but is also resilient in the face of disruption. This includes being able to recover quickly from setbacks, adapt to new circumstances, and continue functioning effectively after a crisis or challenge.

- **Self-Sufficiency**: **Viability** often involves a degree of self-sufficiency, where a system can maintain its own stability and function with minimal external input. This does not mean complete isolation but implies that the system is robust enough to withstand external pressures or changes.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Fragility**: A system or entity that is unable to withstand stress or external pressure is not viable. Systems that are fragile and collapse easily under duress or change are not considered **viable**.

- **Exploitation**: Systems that exploit resources or individuals without considering long-term consequences risk losing their **viability**. Exploiting labor, overexploiting natural resources, or engaging in practices that deplete essential support structures can undermine the system‚Äôs long-term survival.

- **Inefficiency**: A system that wastes resources, time, or effort without achieving its desired results is not **viable**. **Viability** is about making the best use of available assets and avoiding unnecessary loss.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
- **Sideloading** of **viability** occurs when the term is applied to systems that appear to be functioning but are in fact unsustainable or inefficient. For example, a business model that relies on environmental degradation may look viable in the short term but is ultimately not sustainable.

Invalid examples:
- "A business that maximizes profits by exploiting cheap labor in unsafe conditions may appear economically viable but is fundamentally unsustainable and not truly viable in the long term." ‚Üí This is a **false viability**.
- "A system that relies on finite resources, causing long-term ecological harm, cannot be considered truly viable, even if it seems to be functioning in the short term." ‚Üí This is **sideloading** the concept of **viability**.

### üîÅ Variants

- `viability.ecological`: **Ecological viability** refers to the capacity of an ecosystem to function and sustain life over time. It involves maintaining biodiversity, resource availability, and environmental health. A viable ecological system ensures that natural resources are replenished and that species can continue to thrive.

- `viability.economic`: **Economic viability** refers to a business, project, or economy's ability to generate sufficient income or resources to continue functioning over the long term. This includes profitability, sustainability, and the capacity to weather financial crises without collapse.

- `viability.social`: **Social viability** involves the capacity of a society or community to remain stable and harmonious over time. This includes addressing inequalities, fostering social cohesion, ensuring access to essential resources, and maintaining cultural and institutional stability.

- `viability.organizational`: **Organizational viability** refers to an organization‚Äôs ability to adapt, compete, and maintain its operations over time. It encompasses aspects like financial health, leadership stability, workforce capabilities, and adaptability to market changes.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Viability in Governance**: In governance, **viability** refers to the capacity of a government or institutional framework to effectively meet the needs of its population, maintain order, adapt to changing conditions, and ensure long-term social, economic, and environmental health.

- **Public Policy and Viability**: Effective public policies are designed with the **viability** of communities, ecosystems, and economies in mind. This includes long-term planning for infrastructure, health, education, and environmental protection, ensuring that policies are adaptable and can withstand future challenges.

- **Global Viability**: On a global scale, **viability** is tied to international cooperation, especially in addressing challenges like climate change, global health crises, and social inequality. A viable global system relies on the sustainable use of shared resources, collaborative efforts to solve common problems, and equitable development for all nations.
