# Term: capacity

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Capacity** is the actual or potential ability of an individual, group, or system to perform actions, make decisions, solve problems, and sustain outcomes. It includes physical, cognitive, technical, emotional, legal, and institutional dimensions. Without capacity, intention cannot become action. In collective systems, capacity is a shared and interdependent asset, developed over time through access, education, resources, and opportunity.

**Domain**: systemic, organizational, social, legal, cognitive  
**Forms**: capacity (noun), capacitated (adj), capacitation (noun, rarely used), capable (adj)

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Enabling Potential**: **Capacity** is what turns possibility into action. It measures the available or developable ability to carry out intended functions, under real constraints.

- **Multidimensional**: It spans from the individual (skills, health, cognition) to the systemic (infrastructure, policies, technologies). These dimensions interact—weakness in one can limit others.

- **Dynamic and Developable**: Capacity can grow or shrink over time. It responds to investment, learning, environmental changes, and systems of support or neglect.

- **Contextual**: A person or system may have capacity in one domain and not in another. Also, capacity is task-specific: one may have the capacity to speak publicly but not to code software.

- **Capacity ≠ Permission**: Having capacity does not mean being allowed to use it. Likewise, being “allowed” without capacity is tokenistic or performative.

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Nominal Eligibility**: Being assigned a role or permission doesn't guarantee capacity. Example: being named a leader without the training or tools to lead.

- **Potential Alone**: Raw potential is not capacity until it becomes developable or expressible. Talent without opportunity is dormant.

- **Delegation as Proxy**: Having others act on one’s behalf doesn't substitute for one’s own capacity, unless supported by design (e.g., assistive tech, guardianship in rights).

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate.  
- **Sideloading** happens when systems claim individuals “had capacity” as a justification for failure or blame, while having never supported or enabled that capacity. It’s also common in policy: expecting performance without provisioning infrastructure.

Invalid examples:
- “Citizens failed to act against corruption—they had the vote.” → Voting alone doesn’t ensure capacity to resist complex systemic issues.
- “The worker agreed to the contract, so they must have understood it.” → Assumes legal or cognitive capacity without verification.

### 🔁 Variants

- `capacity.individual`: Skills, knowledge, health, and emotional resilience that allow a person to act intentionally and effectively in a domain.

- `capacity.institutional`: The structures, rules, and resources that enable an institution to perform its functions reliably and accountably.

- `capacity.civic`: A population’s combined ability to understand, engage with, and influence political processes and civic decisions.

- `capacity.legal`: The legal recognition of an individual or entity’s ability to enter into agreements, be held responsible, or act with legal standing.

- `capacity.technological`: The infrastructure and tools needed to carry out technical or digital functions (e.g., internet access, platforms, devices, APIs).

- `capacity.shared`: Collective ability that emerges from cooperation—what a group can do together that no member can do alone.

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Capacity Building**: A key goal in governance and development. It refers to the long-term process of improving individuals’ and institutions’ abilities to perform meaningful functions—especially in under-resourced or transitioning systems.

- **Capacity vs. Delegation**: Systems must distinguish between enabling people to act and doing things for them. Over-delegation can hollow out capacity over time.

- **Accountability & Capacity**: Responsibility must match capacity. It is unjust to hold people or groups accountable for actions they lack the capacity to perform or prevent.
