# Term: criteria

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Criteria** are the **explicit, pre-established conditions or standards** by which a decision, judgment, classification, or justification is **evaluated and validated**. In Logotecture, criteria must be **declarative, testable, and context-aware**, forming the **non-negotiable inputs** to any ethical, legal, or systemic process.

**Domain**: decision theory, logic, law, governance, classification systems  
**Forms**: criteria (plural noun), criterion (singular), criterial (adj), criterion set (structured)

**Depends on**:  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **validation@1.0.0**  
- **transparency@1.0.0**  
- **context@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Precedent-Aware**: Criteria must be **defined in advance**, not **retroactively adapted** to justify outcomes.

- **Bounded and Named**: Each criterion must be **individually nameable and describable**, enabling traceability and reuse.

- **Verifiable**: It must be possible to **evaluate whether something meets or fails** each criterion using observable or reasoned input.

- **Contextual**: Criteria may vary by context, but must remain **internally consistent** within each defined scope or process.

---

### 🚫 Exclusions

- **Criteria ≠ Preferences**: Preferences are subjective or negotiable; criteria must be **publicly defensible** and **functionally consistent**.

- **Criteria ≠ Ideals**: Ideals are aspirational; criteria are **operational**—they govern real decisions and system logic.

- **Criteria ≠ Outcomes**: Criteria define what leads to an outcome—they **don’t describe or justify** the outcome itself.

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate.  
Criteria are often **manipulated silently**—excluded, added, or reframed to rig outcomes. In Logotecture, criteria must be **fully declared** and **immutable within scope** unless transparently revised through protocol.

Examples:
- Changing hiring criteria after the selection to favor a preferred candidate.
- Weighting "security" more than "freedom" only when politically convenient.
- Using undefined criteria for banning, censoring, or granting access.

### 🔁 Variants

- `criteria.legal`: Rule sets for determining legality, responsibility, or eligibility under law.

- `criteria.ethical`: Standards like harm minimization, consent, dignity, or proportionality.

- `criteria.functional`: Technical or systemic standards for performance, capacity, or behavior.

- `criteria.access`: Requirements for inclusion, participation, or entitlement.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Criteria Must Be Public**: Systems must **declare the full criteria set** before making decisions that affect rights, access, or status.

- **Immutable During Evaluation**: Once a process begins, the criteria in use **must remain locked** unless a system-level override protocol is triggered and logged.

- **Hierarchies Allowed**: Some criteria can carry **more weight** than others, but this must also be **declared and justified**.

- **Criterial Drift is a Failure**: If criteria evolve in invisible or informal ways, the **outcome is invalidated** under Logotecture.

### 🌍 Why This Matters in Practice

- Without explicit criteria, systems become **arbitrary, biased, or manipulable**—decisions seem unpredictable or unjust.  
- In Logotecture, criteria make decisions **transparent, auditable, and AI-verifiable**.  
- They provide a **defensive layer** against corruption, favoritism, or moral sideloading.  
- Criteria empower participants to **challenge outcomes with logic**, not ideology or emotion.
