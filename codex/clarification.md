# Term: clarification

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Clarification** is the structured process of improving the **comprehensibility**, **accuracy**, or **semantic precision** of a term, idea, or system‚Äîwithout altering its original intention, scope, or legitimized meaning. In Logotecture, clarification strengthens **traceability**, enhances **coherence**, and serves as a **corrective mechanism** in defense of distortion, ambiguity, or misuse.

**Domain**: epistemology, communication, governance, semantic architecture  
**Forms**: clarification (noun), clarify (verb), clarified (adj), clarifying (verb)

**Depends on**:  
- **comprehensibility@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**  
- **documentation@1.0.0**  
- **authenticity@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Intent-Preserving**: Clarification must **retain the original intent** and structure of the term or system. It cannot introduce redefinitions or new authority.

- **Contextual Amplification**: Clarification provides **additional context**, **examples**, or **scoping** to reduce misuse, misreading, or ambiguity.

- **Non-Revisory**: Unlike revision, clarification is **non-transformative**‚Äîits purpose is to **enhance precision**, not to shift meaning.

- **Supportive, Not Overwriting**: It appends or expands existing meaning through **transparent supplementation**, without overriding or replacing definitions.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Silent Substitution**: Any clarification that hides a semantic shift is invalid‚Äîit becomes a vehicle for **revisionism**.

- **Obfuscation through Length**: Over-elaboration that clouds understanding or distracts from original meaning is not clarification.

- **Assumption Injection**: Injecting new beliefs, frameworks, or ideological biases under the guise of clarification is a form of **semantic smuggling**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Low‚ÄìMedium.  
- While clarification is meant to protect meaning, **bad actors** can misuse the form to **redefine** or **soft-edit** meaning. These false clarifications must be audited for traceability and deviation.

Examples:
- ‚úÖ ‚ÄúClarifying that ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô in this context means autonomy from coercion, not from consequence.‚Äù  
- ‚ùå ‚ÄúClarifying that ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô includes loyalty to the regime‚Äù (‚Üê introduces transformation, not clarification)

### üîÅ Variants

- `clarification.semantic`: Strengthens understanding of a term by illuminating **scope**, **intent**, **relational meaning**, and **misuse boundaries**.

- `clarification.legal`: Adds interpretive guidance to laws or contracts **without altering obligations**, often via commentary, notes, or annexes.

- `clarification.operational`: Explains how a system or protocol functions in **specific edge cases** without altering its procedural definition.

- `clarification.historical`: Provides context or origin stories that help explain *why* a term or decision was made, increasing interpretive fidelity.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Clarifications must be linked**: Every clarification must attach to a **base term or version**, and must declare **intent not to revise**.

- **Reviewed, not Authorized**: Clarifications may be proposed by contributors, but require review for **semantic safety** (i.e., that they don‚Äôt mutate meaning).

- **Version Compatibility**: Clarifications apply to specific versions of terms and must be retired or revalidated when the base term is revised.

- **AI Visibility**: Clarifications should be tagged and structured to allow AI agents to distinguish them from definitions or revisions.
