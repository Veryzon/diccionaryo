# Term: entitlement

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Entitlement** is the **formal recognition** of a right, claim, or benefit that a subject or agent is **systemically granted** within a structure, based on established rules, conditions, or values. In Logotecture, entitlement is **not inherent** like dignity or rights—it is a **system-issued construct** that must trace back to **clear criteria, legitimacy**, and **justifiability**.

**Domain**: governance, law, ethics, social theory, benefits systems  
**Forms**: entitlement (noun), entitled (adj), dis-entitlement (conceptual antonym), entitling (verb form)

**Depends on**:  
- **rights@1.0.0**  
- **justification@1.0.0**  
- **legitimacy@1.0.0**  
- **criteria@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Conditional**: Entitlements are not unconditional; they are based on meeting **clearly defined conditions** or being within a **defined status** under systemic rules.

- **System-Bound**: An entitlement must be **anchored to the rules** of a valid, transparent system. Outside of that context, the claim holds **no legitimate force**.

- **Non-Transferable by Default**: Entitlements are **non-transferrable** unless explicitly structured to be. They do not automatically extend to others or become tradable without systemic design.

- **Evidence-Based**: Claims of entitlement must be **backed by traceable authorization** (legal, contractual, or procedural), not simply by expectation or repetition.

---

### 🚫 Exclusions

- **Entitlement ≠ Right**: Rights are **inherent** and cannot be revoked by policy. Entitlements are **granted**, **conditional**, and can be **reviewed, limited, or revoked** under system terms.

- **Entitlement ≠ Expectation**: Social or psychological expectation of a benefit or treatment does **not constitute entitlement** unless backed by **structured guarantees**.

- **Entitlement ≠ Privilege**: Privileges are **discretionary** and subject to revocation without justification. Entitlements are **systemically guaranteed** under terms.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate to High.  
The term "entitlement" is often **misused rhetorically**—either inflated to justify **overreach** or dismissed to justify **neglect**. In Logotecture, entitlement is strictly **criterion-bound** and must **map back to systemic logic** to be valid.

Examples:
- **Over-Entitlement**: Assuming access to services or respect without meeting communal criteria (e.g., claiming “I’m entitled to respect” without reciprocal conduct).
- **Under-Recognition**: Denying rightful entitlements by **relabeling them as “entitlement mentality”**, often as a political maneuver.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `entitlement.legal`: Benefits or protections granted by legal status or legislation (e.g., right to counsel, social security).

- `entitlement.contractual`: Claims or services owed under terms of a formal agreement (e.g., employment benefits).

- `entitlement.systemic`: Access, permissions, or conditions granted by digital or procedural systems (e.g., access roles, privileges in governance protocols).

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Entitlements Must Be Traceable**: Every claim of entitlement must reference its **source criteria**, documentation, or systemic authority. Ambiguity renders the claim structurally invalid.

- **No Emotional Override**: Emotional appeals do **not grant or revoke** entitlements. These are **logic-bound constructs**, not subjective impressions.

- **Correctable**: Entitlements can and must be **reviewed**, especially if built on outdated norms, inequalities, or systemic inefficiencies.

### 🌍 Why This Matters in Practice

- Entitlements are **essential components of systems** that deliver fairness, but they must be **bounded** by clarity and criteria to avoid abuse or imbalance.  
- In Logotecture, entitlements are used to **define scope**, **automate enforcement**, and **remove arbitrariness** from access control and public services.  
- Without disciplined entitlement frameworks, systems **erode trust**, open themselves to **capture**, or **collapse into favoritism** or populism.  
- When clearly defined, entitlements **translate values into structures**, making principles enforceable and legible by both **humans and machines**.
