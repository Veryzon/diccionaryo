# Term: secrecy

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Secrecy** is the **intentional restriction** of access to information, logic, structure, or meaning to a specific group or agent, often for the purposes of **protection**, **control**, or **manipulation**. In Logotecture, secrecy is treated as a **conditional and traceable state**, which must be **declared**, **justified**, and **bounded** to avoid systemic distortion or abuse.

**Domain**: epistemology, security, law, semantics, governance  
**Forms**: secrecy (noun), secret (adj/noun), secrete (verb), secretly (adv)

**Depends on**:  
- **access@1.0.0**  
- **trust@1.0.0**  
- **transparency@1.0.0**  
- **authorization@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Restricted Access**: Only specified agents can access the concealed information or structure.

- **Declared Intent**: In Logotecture, secrecy **must be purpose-bound**, not open-ended or retroactively imposed.

- **Boundary Logic**: Secrecy must be applied via **explicit encapsulation** with **access protocols**, not via vague omission.

- **Time-Sensitive**: Secrecy may degrade into **obfuscation** if prolonged without justification or auditing.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Privacy ‚â† Secrecy**: Privacy protects individuals or agents; secrecy is often organizational or structural in scope.

- **Encapsulation ‚â† Secrecy**: Encapsulation restricts internal interference but does not hide documentation or logic.

- **Opacity by Neglect**: Failing to document or publish something isn't secrecy‚Äîit's **negligence or erosion**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
Secrecy is one of the **main vectors for semantical seizure**, institutional corruption, and **abuse of interpretive power**.

Examples:
- Laws or procedures with **unpublished implementation rules**.  
- Algorithms (AI, legal, bureaucratic) that affect rights but remain undisclosed.  
- Semantic drift occurring in hidden layers of meaning only accessible to an elite.

### üîÅ Variants

- `secrecy.operational`: Tactical or procedural concealment (e.g., security protocols, defense plans).

- `secrecy.structural`: Hidden dependencies, power mechanisms, or data flows in institutional systems.

- `secrecy.semantic`: Undocumented or culturally inherited meanings embedded within otherwise public terms.

- `secrecy.legal`: Closed deliberations, redacted laws, or inaccessible precedents.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Secrecy Declarations**: Every secret must be registered with metadata: purpose, scope, audience, expiration conditions.

- **Auditable Boundaries**: Encapsulated secrets must be **testable by authorized agents**, even if contents are hidden.

- **Time-Bound Review**: Secrets must have defined review cycles to prevent permanence or misuse.

- **Public Indexing**: Even if contents are hidden, the **existence of secrecy** must be known to ensure **traceability**.
