### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Amoral Capacity**: Potestity describes **what can be done**, not **what should** be done. It is the **power of action**, not its justification.

- **Visible or Hidden**: Potestity may be **formalized** (e.g. laws, offices) or **informal** (economic leverage, social influence, algorithmic opacity).

- **Capturable**: Potestity is **transferable**, **replicable**, and often **abused**. It does not require **recognition** or **acknowledgment** to function.

- **Agent-Agnostic**: May be held by **individuals**, **groups**, **states**, **machines**, or **systems**.

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Potestity ‚â† Authority**: Authority implies **recognized legitimacy**, potestity only implies **actionable influence**.

- **Potestity ‚â† Sovereignty**: Sovereignty involves **juridical recognition**, potestity may act **outside or against law**.

- **Potestity ‚â† Consent**: Potestity does not require consent; in fact, it often functions by **bypassing** or **invalidating** it.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**Extremely High**, as many power structures attempt to **rename potestity as authority**, **justice**, or **necessity**.

Common examples:
- Police or military power framed solely as ‚Äúpublic service.‚Äù
- Corporate algorithmic control called ‚Äúuser personalization.‚Äù
- Political coercion branded as ‚Äúleadership.‚Äù
- Cultural dominance presented as ‚Äústandard.‚Äù

### üîÅ Variants

- `potestity.institutional`: The ability of systems or structures to shape outcomes irrespective of public will.

- `potestity.semantic`: Control over **language**, **narratives**, and **definitions**, enabling capture of meaning.

- `potestity.digital`: Data monopolies, black-box AI, and infrastructure gatekeeping exerting silent dominance.

- `potestity.symbolic`: Iconography, historical framing, or mythology used to condition thought without overt force.

- `potestity.performative`: Influence through charisma, attention economy, or spectacle.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Unregulated potestity** is a leading indicator of **corruption**, **oppression**, and **semantic decay**.

- **Transparency Measures**: Systems must expose who holds potestity and **how it‚Äôs exercised**, especially in AI and law.

- **Disentangling Authority**: Societies must continuously audit where **legitimacy ends** and **potestity begins**.

- **Consent Violation**: Potestity is most dangerous when **interpreted as consent**, such as silence = agreement, or exposure = participation.

---

### üåç Why This Matters in Practice

- **Language Abuse**: Potestity is used to redefine words in order to distort reality‚Äîcentral threat that **Logotecture** is designed to resist.

- **AI and Control**: Potestity is being embedded into **automated systems** with no clear feedback or reversibility.

- **Law and Bias**: Laws written under potestity often protect the **powerful** while feigning neutrality.

- **Media and Framing**: Potestity in media controls **what is thinkable**, and thus, what is sayable and possible.

### ‚öôÔ∏è In Logotecture

- **Core Design Guard**: Potestity is the **central adversary** against which Logotecture is structurally immunized.

- **Semantic Anchoring**: Potestity must never be **confused with legitimacy**, and all systems should **flag covert uses** of it.

- **Syntax Traceability**: Any term or action that exercises potestity must be **declared**, **flagged**, and **resolvable** to an actor and mechanism.

- **Linguistic Distinctiveness**: The term is intentionally **unfamiliar** in English to prevent **sideloading by legacy systems**.
