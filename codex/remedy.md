### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Actionable**: A remedy must involve a **concrete action** that can be implemented within the system. It is **not a theoretical solution**.  
- **Proportional**: The remedy must be proportional to the harm or breach and must serve to restore fairness without exacerbating the situation.
- **Definable and Auditable**: Remedies must be clearly defined and **auditable** to ensure that they are applied properly and consistently within the system.  
- **Restorative or Corrective**: Remedial actions can either aim to **restore** the status quo (e.g. compensating for loss) or **correct systemic issues** (e.g. reforming policies to prevent future violations).

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Palliative actions** that do not resolve or directly address the harm (e.g. temporary fixes or band-aid solutions)  
- **Vague or undefined remedies** that cannot be enforced or verified through audit (e.g. “we’ll fix this later”)  
- **Punitive remedies** (e.g. punishment for punishment's sake) unless they directly contribute to restoring fairness or correcting a systemic imbalance

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate.  
- Remedies can be **misused** as a means to appease or superficially resolve issues, without actually addressing the root causes or underlying systems of injustice.

Invalid examples:
- “The remedy is simply to apologize” → an apology must be backed by **action** that addresses the actual harm caused  
- “The company will remedy this by paying fines” → paying fines is **not a remedy** unless it addresses the **specific harm** caused  
- “A reform will be put in place, but we don’t know what or when” → requires clear, **defined actions** and an **enforceable timeline**

### 🔁 Variants

- `remedy.contractual`: remedy defined through contract law, such as **compensation** or **specific performance**  
- `remedy.legal`: judicial remedies provided within the legal framework, such as **court orders**, **injunctions**, or **damages**  
- `remedy.systemic`: remedies for systemic issues that require **structural changes** within a system or society  
- `remedy.restorative`: focuses on healing, **compensating**, and **restoring** affected parties rather than simply penalizing the violator

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Consistency in remedies** is key: The same **violation of the same kind** must lead to the same or similar remedy to ensure fairness in system application  
- Remedies should not just be punitive but should focus on **correcting the harm** and addressing **systemic weaknesses** to prevent future violations  
- Regular **auditability** of remedies applied is essential to ensure that they are working as intended and are not perpetuating further harm
