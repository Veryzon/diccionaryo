### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Historical Overwrite**: Revising a term or doctrine while **erasing or distorting its previous meaning or lineage**.

- **Undocumented Alteration**: Making semantic or procedural changes without maintaining **versioning**, **contextual notes**, or **rationales**.

- **Authority Sourcing**: Revisionist agendas often present themselves as **official**, **progressive**, or **corrective**, even while lacking formal legitimacy.

- **Power Alignment**: Frequently coincides with shifts in **institutional power**, **regime change**, or **agenda imposition**‚Äîwhere meanings are adapted to fit the new dominant narrative.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Transparent Reinterpretation**: If a change is well-documented, historically anchored, and subject to communal or procedural review, it is **not revisionism**.

- **Corrective Clarification**: Legitimate revisions that fix **inaccuracy**, **bias**, or **ambiguity**, when done openly and under protocol, are constructive.

- **Versioned Evolution**: Meaning that evolves under structured semantic governance (via versioning and traceable rationale) is protected.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Critical.  
- Revisionism enables **semantic laundering**, **legitimacy mimicry**, and **authority theft**. It is one of the main exploit paths used to repackage old ideologies in new language or twist protective systems into tools of control.

Examples:
- Replacing ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù with ‚Äúfreedom of state policy‚Äù without redefining or acknowledging the shift.
- Quietly revising laws or charters using terminology whose public meaning diverges from legal application.

### üîÅ Variants

- `revisionism.historical`: Altering the narrative of past events to benefit the current power structure or erase collective memory.

- `revisionism.legal`: Modifying or reinterpreting legal language or doctrine while preserving the **appearance of continuity**.

- `revisionism.linguistic`: Changing the meaning or connotation of a term without public deliberation, especially in dictionaries, media, or official discourse.

- `revisionism.institutional`: When an organization adopts new behaviors or goals while maintaining **legacy legitimacy**, without acknowledging its actual change in nature.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Revisions must be marked**: All modifications in Logotecture require **semantic versioning**, **justification logs**, and **parental linkage** to previous meanings.

- **Revision requests are procedural**: Changes to core terms must pass through **community review**, and **rationale disclosure** is mandatory.

- **Inversion Alerts**: If a new definition *opposes or flips* the logic of a previous one, it must be **explicitly declared** and **rationalized**‚Äîor flagged as hostile revisionism.

- **AI Validation**: Tools can be used to **compare past and current versions** to detect unauthorized or stealth changes to critical concepts.
