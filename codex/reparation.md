### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Restorative**: Reparation focuses on **restoring** the status quo or **correcting the imbalance** caused by the violation  
- **Compensatory**: Often involves some form of **compensation** — whether financial, social, or symbolic — aimed at **offsetting the harm** caused  
- **Collective or Individual**: Can be applied to **individuals** or **groups** (e.g. historical reparations for marginalized communities)  
- **Long-term Impact**: Aimed not just at short-term redress, but also at **long-term societal change** or **healing** for affected parties

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Punitive actions**: Reparation is not about punishment; it is focused on **compensating and healing**  
- **Superficial gestures**: Reparation cannot be reduced to merely **symbolic acts** unless accompanied by real, **measurable restitution**  
- **Retaliatory measures**: Reparation is about **restoring balance**, not about seeking **revenge** or **further harm**

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Reparation is **often reduced to political tools** that lack substantial substance or are used as **performative gestures** without addressing the **underlying systemic issues**.

Invalid examples:
- “We will provide reparations in the form of symbolic recognition” → unless backed by **concrete restitution** or **systemic change**, this is **not sufficient**  
- “A government acknowledges its historical wrongs but does nothing to address the **real harms**” → **actionable reparations** must follow acknowledgment  
- “Reparation is just a financial payout” → should involve **multi-faceted compensation**, considering the **long-term effects of harm** and not just **monetary** solutions

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `reparation.financial`: compensation through **monetary means**, often used in cases where material losses occurred (e.g. **damages** or **settlements**)  
- `reparation.symbolic`: acknowledging harm without direct compensation, often aimed at restoring dignity or providing **official apologies**  
- `reparation.systemic`: addressing the **systemic causes** of harm through policy changes, social initiatives, or legislative reform (e.g. **affirmative action** or **land restitution**)  
- `reparation.collective`: collective efforts to compensate or repair for harm inflicted on an entire group or community (e.g. **reparations for slavery**, **indigenous land rights**)

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Comprehensive Compensation**: Reparation is not just about **restoring financial loss** but also **addressing emotional harm**, **social status**, and **long-term consequences**.  
- **Clear Implementation**: A **defined process** must be in place to ensure reparations are actionable, measurable, and **not left in perpetuity without resolution**.  
- **Collective Accountability**: Reparations often need to address **structural issues**, so **systemic reforms** and **broader societal changes** must be part of the solution to achieve true reparation.
