# Term: discretionary

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Discretionary** refers to any **decision, action, or grant** that is based on **authorized judgment, preference, or interpretation** within a defined scope of power, **rather than strict rules or criteria**. In Logotecture, discretionary power is **bounded, logged, and transparently scoped**, to avoid becoming a **vehicle for arbitrariness, bias, or unaccountable authority**.

**Domain**: governance, legal systems, administration, automation  
**Forms**: discretionary (adj), discretion (noun), at discretion (phrase)

**Depends on**:  
- **authority@1.0.0**  
- **scope@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**  
- **validation@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Judgment-Based**: Discretionary decisions rely on an **agent's reasoning or evaluation**, not on strict procedural automation.

- **Power-Scoped**: The authority to act at discretion must be **explicitly granted** and **circumscribed by domain or limits**.

- **Conditionally Legitimate**: A discretionary action is valid **only when the actor has defined discretion** over that domain and can **justify the decision**.

- **Risk-Linked**: Discretionary power **increases the risk of inconsistency, favoritism, or misuse**—thus demands oversight and logging.

---

### 🚫 Exclusions

- **Discretionary ≠ Arbitrary**: Arbitrary means unstructured and unjustified; discretionary must be **based on reasoning within granted bounds**.

- **Discretionary ≠ Absolute Power**: Discretion cannot override system laws, ethics, or accountability structures.

- **Discretionary ≠ Random**: It must follow **defensible logic or contextual reasoning**, not whims or instinct.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

**High**.  
“Discretion” is often used to **mask partiality, bias, or misuse of power**. Logotecture restricts discretionary actions to **well-defined, documented scopes** and requires **auditability of the rationale**.

Examples:
- A judge using "discretion" to issue vastly different sentences for similar cases.
- Discretionary funding to favored regions or actors with no declared reasoning.
- AI systems embedded with silent "discretion" that lacks human-interpretable logic or override pathways.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `discretionary.legal`: Areas where officials (e.g. judges, officers) may interpret and act within bounds of law.

- `discretionary.operational`: On-the-fly decision-making permitted in dynamic systems (e.g., emergency routing, triage).

- `discretionary.administrative`: Internal decision-making space given to managers, directors, or agents under policy frameworks.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Discretion Must Be Scoped**: Every use of discretion must be **tied to a defined authority**, context, and consequence boundary.

- **Justification Required**: All discretionary acts must produce **logically defendable reasoning** linked to precedent, policy, or objectives.

- **Oversight Structures**: Systems must include **post-action review**, appeal pathways, and bias audits to **check discretion abuse**.

- **Fail-safe Lockout**: When in doubt, systems should default to **non-discretionary fallback mechanisms** to preserve predictability.

---

### 🌍 Why This Matters in Practice

- Discretion can be used for **nuanced, situational decisions**—but also for **covert abuse, favoritism, or evasion of responsibility**.  
- Logotecture seeks to make discretion **usable but non-corruptible** by encoding it as **bounded, reasoned, and always traceable**.  
- Systems with well-scoped discretion preserve both **human flexibility** and **machine-verifiable fairness**.
