# Term: validation

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Validation** is the process by which a claim, condition, structure, or action is formally assessed to determine whether it **meets its defined criteria**, **matches its intended purpose**, or is **authorized to operate** within a given system. In Logotecture, validation is an **explicit, system-governed operation**, essential for enabling trust, automation, and ethical governance.

**Domain**: systems theory, governance, law, programming, protocol design  
**Forms**: validation (noun), validate (verb), validated (state), validator (agent or process)

**Depends on**:  
- **criteria@1.0.0**  
- **justification@1.0.0**  
- **authorization@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Criterion-Based**: Validation is always tied to **predefined criteria**—there is no such thing as “free-form” validation.

- **Outcome-Binding**: If validation passes, the claim or object becomes **recognized or actionable** in the system.

- **Systematic and Repeatable**: Validation must be **performable by independent actors** or automated processes and **return the same result** when inputs match.

- **Logically or Mechanically Enforced**: In Logotecture, validation is not a subjective opinion—it is **logical or procedural** and built into the structure.

---

### 🚫 Exclusions

- **Validation ≠ Approval**: Approval can be subjective, hierarchical, or political; validation is **objective**, **criteria-driven**, and **replicable**.

- **Validation ≠ Belief or Agreement**: A belief held by many does not validate a claim unless it passes **formal tests** of truth or system fit.

- **Validation ≠ Trust**: Trust may precede validation, but validation is what makes trust **verifiable and system-compatible**.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate to High.  
Validation is often **faked or claimed without structure**, especially in systems with poor traceability. In Logotecture, all validation **must be demonstrable**, recorded, and linked to **the source criteria and process**.

Examples:
- Declaring a law “validated” by precedent without citing its logical consistency or legal criteria.
- Marking a document as “validated” without any procedural audit trail.
- Social or political consensus overriding the failure to meet actual system validation requirements.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `validation.logical`: Uses rules, consistency, or formal logic to determine soundness (e.g., mathematical proof, type-checking).

- `validation.legal`: Confirmation that a norm, decision, or status complies with legal rules and jurisdiction.

- `validation.ethical`: Checks alignment with predefined ethical protocols or values (e.g., human dignity, fairness).

- `validation.systemic`: Ensures that an object or action fits within a larger structure (e.g., a valid digital signature, access token).

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Mandatory Before Execution**: No system action may proceed unless validated by a **recognized process** tied to defined criteria.

- **Validation Is Loggable**: Every validation must produce **audit logs or verifiable metadata**, making retroactive review possible.

- **Validator Independence**: Validators (whether human, institutional, or machine) must be **functionally independent** from the outcome they are validating.

- **Non-Validation = Inaction**: An object, claim, or right that **has not been validated** remains **inert or unrecognized** until it passes.

### 🌍 Why This Matters in Practice

- Without clear validation processes, systems are vulnerable to **fraud, error, corruption, or manipulation**.  
- Logotecture uses validation to make **truth, eligibility, and structure verifiable by AI**, humans, and independent logic alike.  
- It ensures **traceable governance**: no enforcement, status, or privilege appears in the system without a reasoned validation path.  
- It allows people to **challenge or verify claims** without conflict—if it’s not validated, it’s not binding.
