# Term: encapsulation

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Encapsulation** is the practice of **isolating the internal structure, logic, and behavior of a semantic, legal, or operational module**, exposing only what is necessary for external use. In Logotecture, it serves as a **defense layer** around terms or concepts, protecting them from unintended reinterpretation, overreach, or unauthorized dependency.

**Domain**: system design, semantics, governance, software, epistemology  
**Forms**: encapsulation (noun), encapsulate (verb), encapsulated (adj)

**Depends on**:  
- **modularity@1.0.0**  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **scope@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Boundary Definition**: A module defines **what is internal** (private logic) vs. **what is public** (interfaces or exposed meaning).

- **Controlled Exposure**: Only essential elements are exposed for interaction‚Äînothing more. This limits **semantic bleed**.

- **Resilience Through Isolation**: Encapsulated modules can be changed internally without breaking outside systems‚Äîif their interface remains unchanged.

- **Protection from Sideloading**: External languages, ideologies, or systems cannot force reinterpretation of encapsulated content **without explicitly entering its interface**.

---

### üöß Exclusions

- **Secrecy ‚â† Encapsulation**: The internal structure must be **documented and traceable**‚Äîjust not exposed by default.

- **Closed Access ‚â† Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is not about hiding data; it's about **managing semantic dependency**.

- **Inflexibility**: Proper encapsulation should not block legitimate extension or interpretation, only **unauthorized mutation**.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Low when correctly implemented.  
Sideloading becomes difficult when a term or structure **only exposes defined interfaces**, rather than allowing full semantic blending.

Examples:
- A legal clause that only refers to predefined, stable terms‚Äîavoiding ambiguous external dependency.  
- A term in the Logotecture dictionary whose definition cannot be overridden by context without explicit redefinition.  
- A machine-readable module that exposes usage, constraints, and interdependencies, but does not allow downstream systems to modify its internal logic.

### üîÅ Variants

- `encapsulation.semantic`: A term that has **clearly scoped boundaries** of meaning, with rules for use and extension.

- `encapsulation.legal`: Laws or clauses that **self-contain their logic** and rely only on defined references, not cultural assumptions.

- `encapsulation.systemic`: Operational units (e.g., code, protocols, procedures) that isolate internal workings behind a known, stable API.

- `encapsulation.knowledge`: Sections of a framework that house **fully documented definitions**, separated from interpretation layers.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Interface Declaration**: Every encapsulated term must publish an **interaction boundary**‚Äîhow it can be used, invoked, or extended.

- **Version Resilience**: Internal updates are allowed without breaking the ecosystem, so long as public interfaces remain valid.

- **Mutation Control**: Only authorized agents (e.g., SIG/Semio or equivalent) can revise internal logic, and all changes must be **versioned**.

- **Context Filtering**: Encapsulation enables the system to **filter unauthorized recontextualization** of terms (a defense against cultural or political distortion).
