# Term: equity

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
The principle of fairness, justice, and impartiality in the distribution of resources, opportunities, and treatment. **Equity** seeks to ensure that individuals and groups are given what they need to succeed, acknowledging that some may require different resources or support than others due to **historical disadvantages**, **structural inequities**, or **individual circumstances**. Unlike **equality**, which focuses on providing the same for all, equity focuses on providing **what is fair**, which may require unequal treatment to achieve **equal outcomes**.

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Fairness**: Equity requires **fair treatment**, which may involve **unequal distribution** of resources or support to address historical or situational disadvantages.
- **Access to Opportunity**: It focuses on providing **equal opportunities** by removing barriers to access and ensuring that everyone has the chance to succeed.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Unlike equality, which assumes a level playing field, equity acknowledges **context**‚Äîrecognizing that people start from different positions and may need **different types** or **amounts** of support to achieve the same outcomes.
- **Corrective Action**: Equity may require taking **corrective measures** to overcome existing social, legal, or economic disparities, such as through **affirmative action** or **redistributive policies**.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Equality (in all cases)**: Equity is distinct from equality. Equality often means treating everyone the same, regardless of their differences or needs, which may perpetuate **disparities**.
- **Favoritism**: Equity is not about giving preference to individuals or groups for arbitrary reasons. It‚Äôs about **addressing systemic disadvantages** with the aim of **creating fairer outcomes**, not **bias** or **unjust preferences**.
- **Tokenism**: Equity must involve meaningful **structural changes**, not superficial adjustments or **symbolic gestures** that do not address underlying inequalities.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Medium to High.  
- **Equity** can be sideloaded if it is used inappropriately or **misapplied** to justify unfair or discriminatory practices under the guise of **fairness**.
- There is also the risk of **equity washing**, where institutions claim to pursue equity but take only **surface-level actions** without meaningful change.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúProviding scholarships only for one gender or race is **equity**, even though it discriminates against others who are equally deserving‚Äù ‚Üí equity must address **historical** or **systemic disadvantages** and not just focus on **preferences**.
- ‚ÄúEquity requires providing the same resources to everyone, regardless of need‚Äù ‚Üí equity means addressing **need**, not treating everyone **identically**.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Proportionality**: Equity requires that support and resources are distributed in a way that is **proportional to need**. This means giving more support to those who have faced the most significant challenges, rather than treating everyone the same.
- **Systemic Change**: To achieve **equity**, institutions must be willing to make **systemic changes** that address **root causes** of inequality and not just focus on superficial fixes.
- **Long-Term Commitment**: True equity requires sustained effort and commitment, as **disparities** are deeply entrenched in many societies, organizations, and legal systems. Short-term solutions are often insufficient to address long-term inequities.
- **Diversity and Inclusion**: Equity works hand-in-hand with **inclusion**. It's not just about giving marginalized groups access to the same opportunities but also ensuring they are **valued**, **included**, and **supported** in the long run.
