### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Subordinate to Strategy**: Tactics **gain meaning only in reference to a strategic framework**.

- **Context-Specific**: Each tactic is **optimized for a particular situation** or moment in time.

- **Adaptive by Nature**: Effective tactics must be **changeable in response to outcomes** or emerging conditions.

- **Operative Scale**: A tactic typically occurs **at the interface between planning and execution**.

---

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Tactic ‚â† Strategy**: A tactic does not define purpose or long-term alignment.

- **Tactic ‚â† Routine**: Not all repeated behaviors are tactical; **tactics are intentional and context-aware**.

- **Tactic ‚â† Trick**: While tactics may involve cleverness, **not all are deceptive or manipulative**.

### üîÅ Variants

- `tactic.semantic`: Adjusting usage, tone, or framing of terms to maintain coherence and block infiltration.

- `tactic.defensive`: Acts of **resilience or disruption minimization** (e.g., counter-messaging, sandboxing).

- `tactic.offensive`: **Proactive maneuvers** meant to gain ground or assert influence.

- `tactic.silent`: **Inferred or omitted behaviors** that shape outcomes by presence of absence.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**High**, especially when used as **justification for unethical or incoherent action**.

- **Detached Tactics**: When used without transparent strategy, tactics may **appear random, manipulative, or contradictory**.

- **Framing Distortion**: The word ‚Äútactical‚Äù is sometimes used to **dignify impulsive, reactive, or regressive actions**.

- **Over-Operationalization**: Systems may prioritize tactics and **lose sight of strategic coherence**.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Tactic Must Point to Strategy**: In Logotecture, a tactic **must be indexable to a defined strategic node**.

- **Documentation Standard**: All tactics, especially those executed by AI agents, must include **metadata for justification and rollback**.

- **Limits and Boundaries**: Tactics must declare **temporal scope, expected impact, and cost thresholds**.

- **Misuse Redress Protocols**: In cases of harm or drift, tactics should be **traceable and interruptible**.

---

### üåç Why This Matters in Practice

- **Preventing Mission Drift**: Tracking tactics helps ensure **short-term moves don‚Äôt erode long-term structure**.

- **Adaptive Governance**: Tactical flexibility allows institutions to **respond without rewriting frameworks**.

- **Empowered Participation**: Well-framed tactics offer **entry points for contributors** who don‚Äôt need full strategic oversight.

- **AI and Autonomy**: Autonomous systems must distinguish **strategic intent from tactical execution** to remain accountable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è In Logotecture

- **Lexical Tactics**: New words, spellings, or definitions may be introduced **tactically**, but only within **strategic bounds**.

- **Moderation Tactics**: Community governance must include tactics for **noise reduction, co-option resistance, and clarity restoration**.

- **Tactic Chains**: Sequences of tactics may be **nested or composed**, but must remain interpretable under strategic logic.

- **Rollback-Ready Design**: All tactical shifts must include **rollback and reassessment mechanisms** in case of harm or misalignment.
