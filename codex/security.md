# Term: security

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Security** is the condition in which systems, structures, or interactions are protected from **unintended interference**, **manipulation**, or **degradation**. In Logotecture, security encompasses both the **physical and semantic domains**, ensuring that meaning and function remain **intact**, **predictable**, and **resilient** against internal or external threats.

**Domain**: governance, cryptography, infrastructure, law, ethics, information systems  
**Forms**: security (noun), secure (adj), securement (noun), insecurity (antonym)

**Depends on**:  
- **resilience@1.0.0**  
- **integrity@1.0.0**  
- **trust@1.0.0**  
- **stability@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Integrity Protection**: Security safeguards the **wholeness of information** and system functions‚Äîensuring that no **undue alterations** take place.

- **Predictable Access**: Authorized interactions are **controlled**, ensuring **safeguarded access** while preventing **unwanted interference**.

- **Resilience Against Disruption**: Security measures anticipate threats and create **structural resilience** to both internal and external disruptions.

- **Confidentiality**: In some contexts, security involves **restricted access** to sensitive information or processes, preserving privacy and **avoiding leaks**.

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity and trustworthiness of participants or systems **ensures proper engagement** in secure exchanges.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Overprotection**: Too much security can lead to **rigidity, inefficiency, or excessive control**, suffocating adaptation and responsiveness.

- **Paranoia**: Security must be **reasoned** and **proportional**; over-securing a non-critical system may lead to **unnecessary restrictions** or even **abuses of power**.

- **Invisibility of Threats**: A system can be **secure in appearance** but **vulnerable to subtle manipulation**‚Äîespecially when certain threats are not recognized or considered.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Security is often **weaponized** to conceal **opportunistic control**, where the claim of "protection" is used as a pretext for **invasive or coercive measures**.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúThe system is secure‚Äù ‚Üí If it blocks meaningful discussion, **hides errors**, or **prevents reform**, it may be **shielding power, not safeguarding integrity**.
- ‚ÄúSecure your rights with this law‚Äù ‚Üí If the law is **only benefiting some**, while repressing others, the claim of **security** is a **manipulative distraction**.

---

### üîÅ Variants

- `security.semantic`: Ensuring that **meaning** cannot be distorted, misinterpreted, or manipulated without proper accountability.

- `security.technical`: Creating **safeguards against digital threats**, such as hacking, data breaches, or unauthorized access.

- `security.legal`: Legal frameworks that ensure **justice and rights are protected**, preventing **unjust manipulation** or **systemic abuses**.

- `security.social`: Ensuring **freedom from coercion** or **violent disruption** in social interactions, fostering a **protected space** for dialogue and participation.

- `security.structural`: Protecting the **frameworks** of systems‚Äîwhether political, social, or technological‚Äîfrom **structural collapse** or **systemic exploitation**.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Security ‚â† Surveillance**: Security is not about **monitoring** or **controlling** every action; it‚Äôs about creating a **safe, resilient system** where unwanted disruption is impossible without transparency.

- **Security ‚â† Inaccessibility**: Secure systems are **open by design** for legitimate, authorized users, maintaining **accessibility while controlling vulnerability**.

- **Layered Security**: Security must be implemented across different **levels**, from **technical protection** (like encryption) to **cultural safeguards** (like ethical standards).
