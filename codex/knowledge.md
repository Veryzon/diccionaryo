# Term: knowledge

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Knowledge** is structured, verified understanding acquired through experience, education, reasoning, perception, or communication. It is information made reliable and meaningful by context, validation, and use. Knowledge differs from raw data or belief in that it can be explained, justified, and applied. It exists both individually and collectively, and underpins systems of logic, law, science, governance, and meaning.

**Domain**: epistemology, education, governance, technology, social systems  
**Forms**: knowledge (noun), know (verb), known (adj), knowing (adj/verb), knowledgeable (adj)

**Depends on**:

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Justified and Validated**: Unlike belief or opinion, knowledge must be **justified** and, in principle, **verifiable**. The standard of validation may differ (scientific, experiential, legal, etc.), but justification is essential.

- **Context-Embedded**: **Knowledge** lives in context‚Äîit is not a floating universal. It is always embedded in systems of meaning, use, and interpretation.

- **Transferable and Evolvable**: Knowledge can be recorded, taught, transferred, refined, and disproven. Its power is not in being static but in being **reproducible and falsifiable**.

- **Cumulative**: Societies build knowledge in layers‚Äîwhat we know today often depends on the retention, correction, or reinterpretation of what came before.

- **Collectively Shaped**: While individuals can discover or hold knowledge, its validation and survival often rely on **collective recognition** and institutional memory.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Data Alone**: Raw, unprocessed facts or measurements are not knowledge until they are organized, interpreted, and given meaning.

- **Belief Without Verification**: Strong conviction without evidence or structured logic may be personally powerful, but it is not **knowledge** unless it can be justified or demonstrated.

- **Secrets or Non-Communicables**: While private insight exists, knowledge must, in principle, be **transmissible**. If it cannot be taught, translated, or applied, it‚Äôs not operative in knowledge systems.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Very high.  
- **Sideloading** occurs when the term "knowledge" is used to give **authority** to unfounded claims, cultural biases, or ideological systems. For example, presenting **opinion** as **knowledge** to influence law or policy.

Invalid examples:
- "Everyone knows this is true." ‚Üí Appeals to consensus, not evidence.
- "Traditional knowledge says X, therefore it cannot be questioned." ‚Üí Cultural insight may contain valuable knowledge, but must still be open to scrutiny when it enters formal systems.

### üîÅ Variants

- `knowledge.tacit`: Internalized, experiential knowledge that is hard to fully express in language (e.g., how to ride a bike or navigate social cues).

- `knowledge.explicit`: Codified and recorded knowledge, often found in books, laws, databases, or formal procedures.

- `knowledge.practical`: Focused on actionable insight or technical skill. Often domain-specific.

- `knowledge.systemic`: Knowledge about systems‚Äîhow parts interact, evolve, or create emergent behavior.

- `knowledge.traditional`: Intergenerationally transmitted knowledge within communities, often incorporating environmental, medical, or cultural insight.

- `knowledge.generated`: Knowledge derived from artificial intelligence or machine learning systems, requiring special treatment for provenance and reliability.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Knowledge and Power**: Control over what is accepted as knowledge shapes systems of authority, justice, and legitimacy. This is why epistemological clarity is central to antifragile language.

- **Institutional Knowledge**: Organizations and governments maintain internal memory through archives, policies, and experience‚Äîthis is their knowledge substrate. Its integrity is critical for continuity and accountability.

- **Knowledge Rights**: Who owns, produces, or can access knowledge is a political question. Open knowledge systems democratize this; closed systems consolidate it.
