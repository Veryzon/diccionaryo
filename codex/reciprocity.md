### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Mutual Exchange**: At its core, **reciprocity** involves a balanced exchange where each party provides something valuable to the other. This exchange can take the form of resources, services, emotional support, or information, and it fosters a sense of equality and mutual respect. It can occur on a personal, community, or global scale.

- **Fairness**: **Reciprocity** is built on fairness, meaning that the value exchanged should be roughly equivalent. When one party contributes disproportionately more than they receive, the balance is disturbed, leading to inequality and potential resentment. Fair **reciprocity** promotes equitable relationships, where everyone‚Äôs contributions are valued.

- **Mutual Benefit**: **Reciprocity** is rooted in the idea that both parties in the exchange should benefit from the relationship. In social, economic, or legal contexts, this could mean ensuring that individuals or groups who engage in reciprocal relationships both see positive outcomes from their interactions.

- **Social Trust**: **Reciprocity** fosters trust within societies or communities. When people know that their contributions will be reciprocated, they are more likely to engage in cooperative behaviors. This social trust is essential for the smooth functioning of many systems, from local communities to global agreements.

- **Cultural Norms**: Many cultures have developed norms and rituals around **reciprocity**, establishing expectations for how people should respond to favors or assistance. These cultural practices help maintain social order and support community cohesion by guiding interactions and reinforcing reciprocal obligations.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Unilateral Exchange**: If one party continually provides without receiving any benefit or reciprocation, this leads to **exploitation** rather than **reciprocity**. The relationship becomes imbalanced, and one side is unfairly burdened.

- **Coercion**: **Reciprocity** cannot be coerced. True **reciprocity** is based on voluntary actions, where all parties willingly offer and receive in equal measure. If one side is forced to participate, or if there is an imbalance of power, the exchange is no longer reciprocal.

- **One-Sided Generosity**: Acts of generosity that do not expect anything in return (e.g., philanthropy, altruism) are **not reciprocity**. While they contribute to social good, they lack the principle of mutual exchange that defines **reciprocity**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Moderate.  
- **Sideloading** of **reciprocity** occurs when the term is applied to relationships that are not truly mutual but are framed as such. This could happen in situations where one party is disproportionately benefiting from an exchange without giving anything of equivalent value in return, such as in exploitative labor practices.

Invalid examples:
- "The company implemented a **reciprocal** work system where employees give extra unpaid hours in exchange for ‚Äòfuture benefits‚Äô that never materialize." ‚Üí This is **exploitation**, not **reciprocity**.
- "A political leader promises **reciprocal** support to another leader in exchange for a personal favor, disregarding the well-being of the citizens." ‚Üí This is **corruption**, not **reciprocity**.
