### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Intention Made Durable**: A commitment transforms **a one-time decision** into a **persistent action or state**.

- **Volitional Origin**: Commitments stem from **free choice or acknowledged duty**, not imposition alone.

- **Resilience Under Pressure**: It is **tested and maintained across obstacles**, which defines its strength.

- **Public or Private**: Commitments may be **declared to others** or **held internally**, but both affect trust and behavior.

---

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Commitment ‚â† Contractual Obligation**: Contracts are **externalized and legally binding**; commitment includes **internal resolve**.

- **Commitment ‚â† Emotion**: It is not driven by feeling alone, but by **deliberate alignment with values or promises**.

- **Commitment ‚â† Compulsion**: Something done under coercion or threat **does not qualify** as true commitment.

### üîÅ Variants

- `commitment.legal`: Formalized commitment via enforceable instruments like laws or pacts.

- `commitment.ethical`: Personal or collective moral dedication to act according to shared principles.

- `commitment.temporal`: Commitment with a defined **duration or review period**.

- `commitment.asymmetric`: Unequal commitments that may reflect power differences or unbalanced expectations.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**Moderate**, mostly in **rhetorical and emotional manipulation**.

- **Commitment as Compliance**: Masking imposed duties as chosen commitments.

- **Symbolic vs. Functional**: Declared commitments that **lack actionable structure or follow-through**.

- **Overcommitment**: Dilution of real commitments due to **excessive or unsustainable obligations**.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Trace Duration & Conditions**: All formal commitments should declare **lifespan, review dates, and exit criteria**.

- **Confirm Capacity**: Before formalizing commitment, validate **ability and conditions for fulfillment**.

- **Scope Anchoring**: Commitments should clearly state their **subject, domain, and boundary conditions**.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Incorporate paths for **reassessment or renegotiation**, avoiding brittle persistence.

---

### üåç Why This Matters in Practice

- **Trust Formation**: Commitment sustains **relational trust** in contracts, communities, and institutions.

- **Resilience of Agreements**: Durable commitments **anchor behavior over time**, despite changing contexts.

- **Policy Execution**: Governance without commitment results in **surface-level implementation or decay**.

- **Machine-Human Systems**: Autonomous systems must encode **verifiable commitments** for reliable interaction.
