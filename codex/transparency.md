### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Openness**: Transparency demands that information, decision-making processes, and actions be **openly shared** and not hidden from those affected or those with a stake in the outcome.  
- **Clarity**: Transparency is not just about sharing information; it is about ensuring that the information is **clear**, **comprehensible**, and **not misleading**.  
- **Access**: It ensures that relevant information is **accessible** to all parties involved, promoting a level of **equality** in the decision-making process.  
- **Visibility**: Decisions, processes, and operations must be **visible**, allowing all stakeholders to understand how and why actions are being taken.

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Secrecy**: Any process that intentionally **hides information** or **limits access** to key data violates the principle of transparency.  
- **Obfuscation**: Even if information is shared, it must not be **deliberately complicated** or **obfuscated** in ways that make it difficult to understand or use.  
- **Selective Disclosure**: Transparency requires **full disclosure**; selectively sharing only parts of the information or data to serve a particular agenda undermines trust and fairness.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Medium.  
- **Transparency** is vulnerable to being **reinterpreted** or **watered down** as a tool for **performative openness** without **genuine access** to information.  
- There is a risk of **superficial transparency**, where institutions or systems **present information** but without offering a clear **understanding** or **context** for it.

Invalid examples:
- “We will hold a public meeting, but only a few will have access to the data” → transparency requires **equal access** for all relevant stakeholders.  
- “The government will release a report, but only in a summarized format that excludes key details” → transparency requires **full disclosure**, not just **high-level summaries**.  
- “We publish annual reports, but they are written in technical jargon only experts can understand” → transparency needs to ensure **clarity** and **comprehensibility**, not just the publication of reports.

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Clear Communication**: Transparency is not just about **disclosing information**; it is about **clearly communicating** the reasoning behind decisions, the consequences of actions, and how they impact stakeholders.  
- **Real-time Transparency**: Transparency should be **ongoing** and not just at particular moments. Real-time transparency, such as **open data platforms** or **live reports**, ensures that there are no gaps or hidden actions.  
- **Engagement and Feedback**: Transparency also means providing opportunities for **feedback** and **engagement** from stakeholders. This process should be **interactive**, allowing stakeholders to question, discuss, and understand actions.  
- **Traceability**: Transparency is tied to the ability to **trace** decisions and actions back to their source. This requires clear **documentation** and **auditing systems** to confirm the veracity of the shared information.
