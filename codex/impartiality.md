### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Neutrality**: Impartiality requires **neutrality** in decision-making, where **personal feelings**, **bias**, or **conflicts of interest** do not influence the outcome.
- **Consistency**: Decisions must be made using the same criteria and processes across all cases, ensuring **equal treatment** and **uniformity** in judgment.
- **Objectivity**: Impartiality demands that decisions are based on **facts**, **evidence**, and **objective standards** rather than on subjective preferences or external pressures.
- **Independence**: To maintain impartiality, decision-makers must be independent from external influence, ensuring that their judgment is **unaffected** by external forces like power, money, or personal connections.

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Favoritism**: Favoring one party or individual over another based on personal interest, relationships, or social status undermines impartiality and results in **unfair** or **biased** outcomes.
- **Prejudices**: Any form of prejudice (e.g., based on race, gender, religion) goes against the principle of impartiality. Prejudices skew decisions and undermine their legitimacy.
- **Conflicts of Interest**: When decision-makers have a personal interest or stake in the outcome, they cannot remain impartial. Full transparency and recusal are necessary to maintain impartiality.
- **Partiality**: A direct opposite of impartiality, partiality is the act of making decisions based on **personal preferences**, **relationships**, or **bias**, rather than on fairness or equality.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- **Impartiality** is often vulnerable to sideloading when decision-makers or systems are influenced by external pressures such as political affiliation, financial incentives, or media narratives.
- **Bias** can be subtly inserted into the decision-making process, even when the system claims impartiality, leading to systemic inequalities.

Invalid examples:
- “The judge ruled in favor of the defendant due to their **family connections**” → impartiality is compromised when **relationships** influence decisions.
- “The decision was based on the **popularity** of the party involved, rather than the facts” → impartiality requires decisions to be grounded in **facts**, not **influence**.
