### üöß Exclusions

- **Inefficiency**: An **institution** that becomes overly bureaucratic, rigid, or inefficient, to the point of hindering its intended purpose, may lose its legitimacy and fail to serve society effectively.
- **Corruption**: When **institutions** are undermined by corruption, cronyism, or the concentration of power in the hands of a few, they can fail to uphold their social functions and may perpetuate inequality or injustice.
- **Exclusion**: **Institutions** that marginalize or exclude certain groups, whether based on gender, race, class, or ideology, undermine the principle of equality and often perpetuate **social injustice**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
- **Sideloading** occurs when institutions are **manipulated** by powerful groups or individuals to **serve narrow interests** rather than the public good, compromising their effectiveness and fairness.
- **Institutional capture** refers to the way in which powerful entities gain control over institutions to make decisions that benefit themselves at the expense of broader society. This could happen in government bodies, corporations, or legal systems.
- **Cultural hijacking** can sideload institutions when they become influenced by cultural or political ideologies that prioritize a specific worldview or agenda over neutrality and objectivity.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúA **legal institution** claims to serve justice but regularly enacts laws that disproportionately harm marginalized communities‚Äù ‚Üí an **institution** serving injustice betrays its core purpose.
- ‚ÄúAn **education institution** that fosters inequality by providing better resources to certain social classes‚Äù ‚Üí **institutions** must promote fairness and equal access to opportunities.
