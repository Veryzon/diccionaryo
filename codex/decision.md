### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Causality-Based**: Decisions must be **justifiable** by input conditions, principles, or logic. This ensures **traceability** and **legitimacy**.

- **Non-Reversible (in context)**: Once made, a decision usually carries **consequences**, meaning it affects other decisions or states. Reversibility must be explicitly stated.

- **Bounded**: A decision is always **made within limits**‚Äîtemporal, contextual, logical, or jurisdictional.

- **Actuating**: A decision often **triggers action**, such as enforcement, commitment, or system change.

- **Evaluable**: The soundness of a decision can be tested against its **premises**, **goals**, and **impacts**.

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Decision ‚â† Thought**: Thinking or considering does not constitute a decision. A decision is **concluded and active**.

- **Decision ‚â† Preference**: Preferences express inclination. A decision requires **resolution** and **consequence**.

- **Decision ‚â† Arbitrary Action**: A decision must include an **internal logic** or **external basis**. Arbitrary or impulse-based acts do not qualify.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**High**, especially in governance and legal language.  
Decisions are often **presented as neutral**, but can be:

- **Opaque in logic**, hiding motives or errors  
- **Untraceable**, making accountability impossible  
- **Framed as ‚Äòinevitable‚Äô**, removing space for challenge  
- **Pre-scripted**, giving the illusion of deliberation where none occurred

### üîÅ Variants

- `decision.legal`: Rendered within a legal framework, tied to laws, precedents, and process (e.g. judicial ruling)

- `decision.administrative`: Operational or organizational decisions with procedural impact (e.g. funding allocation)

- `decision.automated`: Made by algorithms or systems under defined logic or AI-driven criteria

- `decision.consensual`: Based on collective agreement rather than authority alone

- `decision.conflictual`: Arising from contested perspectives; may require arbitration or negotiation

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Decision Logs**: All system-level decisions must be **recorded**, **timestamped**, and **rationalized** with reference to inputs and criteria.

- **Appeal Pathways**: For every critical decision, there must be a known **mechanism for review** or **appeal**.

- **Transparency & Explainability**: In any setting involving **AI or authority**, decisions must be **explainable** in plain language and **linked to accountable agents**.

- **Premise Clarity**: A valid decision shows **what was considered**, **why it was selected**, and **what it rejects**.

---

### üåç Why This Matters in Practice

- Decisions **define direction** in policy, justice, programming, and social contracts. Bad or hidden decisions **corrode legitimacy**.

- **Logotecture** enforces decision structures that are **transparent**, **evaluatable**, and **documentable**, especially in automated environments or high-stakes governance.

- Without clear concepts of **decision**, systems lack **closure**, **predictability**, and **operability**‚Äîkey values in this framework.
