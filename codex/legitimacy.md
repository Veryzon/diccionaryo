# Term: legitimacy

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
The validated right or authorization of an agent or system to exercise power, enforce obligations, or dictate action, derived from formal recognition within an established framework, governed by clear, traceable rules and principles.

**Domain**: legal, political, philosophical, systemic  
**Forms**: legitimacy (noun), legitimate (adj), legitimized (verb), to legitimize (verb), illegitimacy (negated)

**Depends on**:  
- authority@1.0.0  
- recognition@1.0.0  
- legitimacy.protocol@1.0.0  
- system@1.0.0  
- validity@1.0.0

### 🔍 Core Criteria

- **Formal recognition**: legitimacy originates from **formal processes**, such as **election**, **contract**, **system definition**  
- **Verification and auditability**: legitimacy is not abstract; it must be **verifiable** through system logs, protocols, or transparent processes  
- **Non-arbitrary**: legitimacy must not be based on **hereditary**, **cultural**, or **symbolic** claims without clear validation within the system  
- **Consensus-backed**: derived from a collective or authoritative agreement within the **legal, procedural, or societal system**

---

### 🛑 Exclusions

- **Illegitimate authority** (e.g. "power by force") — lacks formal recognition  
- **Unacknowledged legitimacy** (e.g. "self-proclaimed legitimacy") — legitimacy **must** be documented and traceable  
- **Cultural legitimacy** (e.g. “legitimate by tradition”) is **not** valid unless formalized in a system

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Extreme.  
- Often confused with **dominance**, **power**, or **popularity**  
- Frequently invoked rhetorically or as a **justification** for illegitimate acts

Invalid uses:
- “This law is legitimate because it’s popular” → must be validated through **legal framework** and **auditability**  
- “He is the legitimate ruler” → must show clear **formal recognition**, **system boundaries**, and **auditability**  
- “It’s legitimate to break the law for the greater good” → requires **constitutional** or **systemic amendment** under **legally scoped conditions**

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `legitimacy.contractual`: legitimate authority or action derived from formal agreements or contracts  
- `legitimacy.legal`: legitimate authority defined through codified law  
- `legitimacy.systemic`: derived from system-design rules or processes  
- `legitimacy.consent`: legitimate power gained through explicit or tacit agreement from stakeholders  

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- Legitimacy cannot exist **in isolation** — it must be anchored to **system** and **validation mechanisms**  
- **Invisibility of legitimacy** (i.e., untraceable or secret processes) **weakens** its operational power  
- **Loss of legitimacy** renders systems and authority invalid unless re-legitimized through defined procedures
