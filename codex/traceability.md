# Term: traceability

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Traceability** is the property of a term, decision, action, or structure that allows its **origin**, **evolution**, and **justification** to be followed backward through a clear and verifiable **chain of records**. In Logotecture, traceability is mandatory for preserving **semantic integrity**, enabling **versioned governance**, and preventing **unauthorized reinterpretation** or **semantic forgery**.

**Domain**: governance, epistemology, data systems, linguistics, legal frameworks  
**Forms**: traceability (noun), traceable (adj), trace (verb), tracing (verb)

**Depends on**:  
- **documentation@1.0.0**  
- **identity@1.0.0**  
- **revision@1.0.0**  
- **authority@1.0.0**  
- **recognizability@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Historical Anchoring**: Every accepted concept, definition, or change must point to **when, how, and by whom** it was introduced or altered.

- **Justification Chain**: Traceability includes the **rationale** behind decisions, not just the act itself. It‚Äôs not enough to see *what* changed‚Äî*why* matters.

- **Link Integrity**: A break in the trace breaks the concept. Each entry must connect backward and forward, maintaining **semantic continuity** and **auditability**.

- **Forking Visibility**: If a concept diverges or is contested, traceability shows which branch it came from and why it was separated, preventing hidden redefinitions.

- **Linkage Over Time**: Traceability provides a **chronological path** from origin to current state, supporting audit and rollback.

- **Relational Mapping**: Every item should link to **what it depends on**, **what it modifies**, and **what depends on it**‚Äîforming a semantic graph.

- **Causal Visibility**: Not only *what* changed, but *why* it changed must be documented. This connects **meaning** to **intent**.

- **Multi-Agent Legibility**: Traceable structures must be legible to both **human agents** and **machine processes**, enabling scalable validation.

- **Fork-Aware**: If a term splits into versions, traceability preserves their **common ancestry**, **differentiation

### üöß Exclusions

- **Ahistoricism**: Concepts or systems introduced without background, intent, or authorship are untraceable and therefore unauthoritative in Logotecture.

- **Post Hoc Attribution**: Trying to add traceability *after the fact* without original records or valid references breaks semantic credibility.

- **Isolated Fragments**: Content with no linked context or origin (e.g. "found terms") cannot be fully accepted into the structured language system.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Very High.  
- Without traceability, meaning becomes vulnerable to **co-option**, **revisionism**, and **counterfeit legitimacy**. Terms can be stolen, redefined silently, or infused with false authority.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always used it this way‚Äù ‚Üí Lacks documented origin or change record.
- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs common sense‚Äù ‚Üí No concept qualifies without traceable roots and systemic placement.

### üîÅ Variants

- `traceability.semantic`: The ability to follow the **history of a term's meaning**, its dependencies, and shifts in use across drafts and contexts.

- `traceability.legal`: Clear lineage of decisions, laws, contracts, and case outcomes to prevent arbitrary enforcement or retroactive reinterpretation.

- `traceability.data`: In computational contexts, ensures that data entries, decisions, or outputs can be traced back to their **input, algorithm, or agent**.

- `traceability.authorship`: Documentation of **who authored or approved** a term or change, with timestamps and credentials‚Äîguards against ghost changes.

- `traceability.protocol`: Procedural visibility that allows others to audit whether rules were followed, exceptions were justified, and decisions are repeatable.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Mandatory Inclusion**: No term or system-level decision in Logotecture is valid without a **documented trace**. Omissions are structural defects.

- **Versioned Repositories**: All content must be maintained in **change-tracked environments** (e.g., Git, Semantic Wikis, or LedgerDBs) to preserve proof of evolution.

- **Chain-of-Trust Rules**: If a term is derived from another, the inheritance must be **explicit**, and the parent must be traceable as well.

- **Semantic Ledger Compatibility**: The architecture must allow traceability to be machine-readable and human-readable simultaneously.
