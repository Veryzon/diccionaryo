# Term: evidence

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Evidence** refers to **data, information, or material** that **supports or disproves a claim, action, or hypothesis**. In Logotecture, evidence is **traceable, verifiable**, and **grounded in measurable, documented sources**. It serves as the **objective cornerstone** for any assertion of fact or validity.

**Domain**: logic, law, governance, science, systems  
**Forms**: evidence (noun), evidential (adj), evidencing (verb), evidentiary (adj)

**Depends on**:

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Supportive**: Evidence must **substantiate a claim**. It is the **input** that confirms or denies assertions.

- **Verifiable**: All evidence must be **traceable back to its origin**, and its **authenticity** can be independently confirmed.

- **Objective**: Evidence is **neutral** and must not be **subject to manipulation** or **interpretation** that distorts its meaning.

- **Comprehensive**: Evidence should come from multiple, **diverse sources** to ensure a robust and **holistic view**.

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Evidence ‚â† Assumptions**: Assumptions are unverified, uncertain, and based on subjective belief or speculation. Evidence must be **documented**, **observable**, and **repeatable**.

- **Evidence ‚â† Testimony**: Testimonies, while useful, are **not evidence** unless they can be corroborated by objective data or material.

- **Evidence ‚â† Opinion**: Opinion may inform investigation, but without **factual backing**, it‚Äôs not classified as evidence in Logotecture systems.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**High**.  
Evidence is often **fabricated, selectively presented, or distorted** to support a particular narrative or decision. In Logotecture, any piece of evidence must undergo **scrutiny for authenticity, sourcing**, and **relevance**. Without proper validation, claims of evidence become **manipulable**.

Examples:
- Using **biased surveys** as evidence of societal trends.
- **Cherry-picking data** to support policy decisions while ignoring contrary evidence.
- **Misinterpreting statistics** or findings to fit political or corporate agendas.

### üîÅ Variants

- `evidence.factual`: Concrete, empirical data or material (e.g., physical objects, verifiable measurements).

- `evidence.testimonial`: Accounts or narratives that support a claim, contingent on credibility and corroboration.

- `evidence.expert`: Specialized opinions or findings from subject-matter experts, which must also be measurable and verifiable.

- `evidence.circumstantial`: Evidence that, while not direct, **supports an inference** through connection to other known facts.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Evidence Must Be Traceable**: Every piece of evidence must be **logged** with a **clear provenance** and **timestamp** to allow verification at any time.

- **Test for Reliability**: Evidence must be tested for **accuracy** and **consistency** across sources, and not be **subject to individual bias**.

- **No Evidence ‚â† No Claim**: If a claim cannot be **substantiated by evidence**, it is **not a claim** under Logotecture principles.

- **Cross-Check for Discrepancies**: **Inconsistencies** or **conflicting evidence** should trigger a **re-evaluation** and may require external validation.

---

### üåç Why This Matters in Practice

- Evidence is the **foundation of trust**, transparency, and accountability in systems.  
- It ensures that **decisions are made based on reality, not belief, influence, or manipulation**.  
- Without evidence, Logotecture would collapse into **subjective decision-making**, undermining its goals of objectivity and fairness.
