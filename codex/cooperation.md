### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Shared Goals**: **Cooperation** occurs when individuals or collectives align their goals and resources for a mutual purpose. It often requires **compromise** and the willingness to support others in the pursuit of a **common objective**. The success of cooperation depends on the clarity and mutual understanding of the desired outcome.
  
- **Mutual Benefit**: The key to **cooperation** is that all parties involved gain from the interaction. This mutual benefit may not always be equally distributed, but there must be an overall positive impact for all participants. This fosters a **sense of fairness** and **shared responsibility**.
  
- **Trust and Reciprocity**: Effective cooperation is built on **trust** and the **expectation of reciprocity**. When individuals cooperate, they often rely on the assurance that others will fulfill their parts of the agreement. This trust creates a stable foundation for ongoing collaboration.
  
- **Communication and Coordination**: For **cooperation** to succeed, clear **communication** is essential. Participants need to coordinate their actions, share information, and adapt to changes to ensure that the group‚Äôs collective efforts are directed toward the shared goal. Miscommunication or lack of coordination can lead to misunderstandings and failure of cooperation.
  
- **Voluntary Participation**: **Cooperation** implies voluntary participation, where individuals or groups willingly contribute to a common cause. Forced cooperation or coerced action cannot be considered true cooperation and would often lead to exploitation or resistance.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Coercion**: **Cooperation** must not be forced. If any party is coerced or manipulated into cooperating, it ceases to be genuine **cooperation** and becomes a form of **compliance** or **submission**.
  
- **Exploitation**: In cases where one party benefits significantly more than the others without offering a fair return, the dynamic may be characterized by **exploitation** rather than **cooperation**. Exploitation undermines the principles of fairness and mutual benefit inherent to **cooperation**.
  
- **Self-interest Over Community**: While **self-interest** can motivate **cooperation**, when individuals or groups pursue their own interests at the expense of the collective, the cooperation becomes fragmented or dysfunctional, threatening the **collective good**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Moderate.  
- **Sideloading** of the **cooperation** term may occur when it is used in a context that implies forced collaboration or coercion, which compromises the integrity of **cooperation** as a voluntary, mutually beneficial action. When **cooperation** is framed in a way that ignores the importance of equality, voluntary participation, and fairness, it risks becoming an instrument of manipulation.
  
- **Sideloading** also happens when **cooperation** is narrowly defined to mean only **collaboration for efficiency** or **outcome** without considering the ethical foundations of the relationship. For example, using **cooperation** to justify actions that prioritize economic gain without regard for the well-being of participants would be a distortion of its true meaning.
  
Invalid examples:
- "A **cooperation** between two entities where one entity controls all decisions and the other has no agency." ‚Üí This is **manipulation**, not **cooperation**.
- "The forced **cooperation** of individuals under authoritarian regimes where dissent is punished." ‚Üí This is not true **cooperation**, but **compliance** under threat.

### üîÅ Variants

- `cooperation.voluntary`: **Voluntary cooperation** refers to collaboration where all parties freely choose to work together without external pressure or coercion. This variant emphasizes **autonomy** and **consent** in the cooperative process.
  
- `cooperation.competitive`: In some contexts, **cooperation** can exist in competitive environments where multiple parties work together toward a shared goal but also pursue their own individual success. This form of cooperation exists in settings like business partnerships, where mutual benefit is derived through healthy competition.

- `cooperation.sustaining`: **Sustaining cooperation** refers to long-term collaboration that seeks not only short-term goals but also the continued welfare and growth of all parties involved. This form emphasizes **reciprocity**, **trust**, and sustainable outcomes.

- `cooperation.exclusive`: **Exclusive cooperation** occurs when a group or community forms a cooperative arrangement that excludes outsiders or non-members, often to the benefit of the members. While **exclusive**, this form of cooperation is based on agreed-upon terms within the group.
