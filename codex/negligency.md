# Term: negligency

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Negligency** is the state or behavior of failing to apply appropriate attention, care, or oversight when handling meanings, systems, or decisions, resulting in avoidable harm, fragility, or distortion. In Logotecture, it denotes **semantic irresponsibility** that weakens conceptual coherence or enables further misuse through passive omission.

**Domain**: ethics, law, epistemology, system integrity  
**Forms**: negligency (noun), negligent (adj), neglect (verb/noun), neglected (adj), negligently (adv)

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Omission over Commission**: Negligency often manifests as **what is not done**‚Äîfailing to clarify, maintain, review, or verify.

- **Passive Vulnerability**: It invites breakdowns, misuses, or exploitations by leaving terms, systems, or procedures **unprotected** or **unreviewed**.

- **Absence of Stewardship**: Indicates a lack of semantic **custodianship**, **version discipline**, or **interpretive curation**.

- **Amplifier of Obfuscation**: Even unintentional, negligency can create conditions where **obfuscation**, **revisionism**, and **bias** thrive.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Inaccessibility**: Lack of knowledge or resource constraints may excuse certain lapses, but recurring or unacknowledged neglect is not excused.

- **Refusal with rationale**: Choosing not to act for well-documented, traceable reasons (e.g., prioritization, resource strategy) is not negligency.

- **Systemic Deference**: Waiting for communal input or legal process is not negligence when mechanisms are known and traceable.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Medium‚ÄìHigh.  
Negligency allows harmful actors to **exploit voids**, **redefine by default**, or **abuse vague terms**, especially in law, policy, or public communication.

Examples:
- Failing to clarify a term in law that is then misused in court to exclude protections.
- Neglecting to review a core definition after a system change, leading to contradictions in AI enforcement.
- Publishing semantic material without source linkage or versioning, allowing silent mutations over time.

### üîÅ Variants

- `negligency.legal`: Failure to fulfill obligations of clarity, interpretation, or fairness in drafting or enforcing legal content.

- `negligency.semantic`: Absence of review, annotation, or update to meanings, creating gaps or confusion in usage.

- `negligency.structural`: Omission in maintaining conceptual relationships or logic paths, causing incoherence or dead ends.

- `negligency.institutional`: Failure of systems, actors, or entities to **maintain transparency**, **feedback loops**, or **clarification cycles**.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Negligence Watch**: AI and peer review are used to detect neglected definitions, unlinked terms, or undocumented usages.

- **Documentation Mandate**: New entries and revisions require justifications, lineage, and potential implications to avoid future neglect.

- **Redundancy Check**: Unused or unclear terms must be tagged for audit to prevent **conceptual rot** or **orphan logic**.

- **Care as Protocol**: Semantic care is formalized. Negligence is treated not as an accident but a **system failure** to prevent.
