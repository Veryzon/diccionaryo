# Term: compatibility

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Compatibility** is the condition in which distinct elements—concepts, systems, agents, or protocols—can operate together without **logical contradiction**, **functional disruption**, or **semantic misalignment**. In Logotecture, compatibility is essential to **interoperability**, **semantic layering**, and the **safe exchange of meaning** between different frameworks or actors.

**Domain**: logic, engineering, semantics, governance, systems interoperability  
**Forms**: compatibility (noun), compatible (adj), compatibilize (verb), incompatibility (antonym)

**Depends on**:  
- **coherence@1.0.0**  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **harmony@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Conflict-Free Operation**: Two systems or ideas can function together without breaking rules or causing **semantic collisions**.

- **Shared Baseline**: There exists a **common interpretive or operational ground** (e.g. logic, protocol, definitions).

- **Non-Domination**: Neither side forces assimilation or overrides the identity or rules of the other.

- **Mutual Tolerance**: Variations in form or method do not prevent **semantic or functional exchange**.

- **Traceable Integration**: It is possible to map or align terms and rules **without loss of critical meaning**.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Forced Coexistence**: Just because two things exist in the same space does not mean they are compatible.

- **Superficial Alignment**: Matching labels (e.g., “democracy,” “rights”) without aligned definitions creates **false compatibility**.

- **Sacrificial Adaptation**: If one element must **abandon core logic or structure** to fit another, it’s **assimilation**, not compatibility.

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Compatibility is often **claimed to justify integration** of systems or values that are actually in **epistemic or ethical contradiction**.

Invalid examples:
- “These policies are compatible” → If one violates the premises of the other, that’s **rhetorical masking**.
- “Compatible with our values” → If those values are **undefined**, this claim is **non-falsifiable**.

### 🔁 Variants

- `compatibility.semantic`: Terms or concepts can be **merged, translated, or compared** without distortion.

- `compatibility.legal`: Legal systems can **exchange precedents, definitions, or procedures** without contradiction.

- `compatibility.technical`: Systems can **interoperate** via shared protocols or interfaces without misinterpretation.

- `compatibility.ethical`: Values and principles can be **applied across domains** without triggering ethical collapse.

- `compatibility.structural`: Elements from different frameworks can **coexist** without creating system-level fragility.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Compatibility is Contractual**: When terms or systems claim to integrate, their **shared meaning space must be explicit**.

- **Cross-System Interfaces**: Compatibility requires **clear translation layers**—not just adoption or enforcement.

- **Maintained Through Dialogue**: Compatibility must be **reviewed, tested, and adjusted** as systems evolve.
