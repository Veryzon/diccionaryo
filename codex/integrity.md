# Term: integrity

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Integrity** refers to the quality of being internally consistent, structurally sound, and true to one’s stated form, function, and purpose. It denotes **coherence** between what is declared and what is done, between parts and wholes, and across time. In Logotecture, integrity is a **meta-principle** applied to language, systems, institutions, and individuals. It ensures that meanings are **non-contradictory**, **resistant to exploitation**, and **ethically and functionally aligned** with declared intent.

**Domain**: ethics, logic, systems theory, governance, linguistics  
**Forms**: integrity (noun), integral (adj), disintegrate (verb, opposite), integrality (state), reintegration (restorative process)

**Depends on**:  
- **truth@1.0.0**  
- **functionality@1.0.0**  
- **purpose@1.0.0**  
- **consistency@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Wholeness**: Integrity reflects **unbroken unity**—all components of a system, statement, or identity operate in harmony, without contradiction or hidden agendas.

- **Consistency Over Time**: Integrity requires that systems **maintain fidelity** to their principles or design across conditions, pressures, and contexts.

- **Verifiability**: It must be possible to **examine** the components and compare them to the stated claims or design goals—integrity hides nothing.

- **Resistance to Corruption**: Systems with integrity are **hard to hijack** semantically or structurally. Their internal logic resists being bent by external pressures.

- **Alignment**: There must be **semantic and functional alignment** between intention, structure, output, and interpretation.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Partial Coherence**: A system that performs well in some conditions but contradicts itself or fails under pressure lacks integrity.

- **Facade Alignment**: Appearance of consistency without actual adherence to truth or declared purpose does not qualify.

- **Functional Drift**: If a system slowly or suddenly shifts from its intended purpose without transparency or accountability, its integrity has been compromised.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Very High.  
- Integrity is often **claimed** by institutions or agents to **disarm criticism** or **project legitimacy**, even when internal contradictions, hypocrisies, or systemic failures exist.

Invalid examples:
- “This government acts with integrity.” → If its laws are selectively enforced or its officials act outside declared norms, integrity is absent.
- “The institution has preserved its values.” → If core decisions betray its founding purpose, **value mimicry** is not integrity.

### 🔁 Variants

- `integrity.structural`: The design soundness of a system—its **architecture** supports the stated function and resists collapse or misuse.

- `integrity.semantic`: The **linguistic and definitional clarity** within a system—terms are used consistently and transparently.

- `integrity.functional`: The system performs **as promised**, in all conditions, not just ideal ones.

- `integrity.ethical`: Alignment between declared values and actual behavior, especially in moral, legal, or social domains.

- `integrity.personal`: An individual's ability to act in accordance with their stated beliefs, values, or roles—without hypocrisy or compromise.

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Auditability**: Integrity must be **testable**. If a system claims integrity, its internal logic, processes, and outcomes must be open to review.

- **Continuity**: Integrity isn’t a one-time achievement—it’s a **continuously maintained state** through vigilant alignment and correction.

- **Breach Detection**: Integrity frameworks must include **mechanisms for identifying deviation** from core values, and **restoration protocols** (e.g., reintegration or repair).

- **Non-negotiability**: Some systems (like justice, knowledge validation, or language itself) **collapse if integrity is lost**. For them, integrity is a non-optional prerequisite.
