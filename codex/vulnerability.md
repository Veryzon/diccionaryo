# Term: vulnerability

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Vulnerability** is the condition in which a system, definition, concept, structure, or agent is exposed to potential **harm**, **distortion**, **exploitation**, or **failure** due to inherent **weaknesses**, **omissions**, or **external pressures**. In Logotecture, identifying and documenting vulnerability is essential for building **resilience**, **semantic robustness**, and **interpretive reliability**.

**Domain**: security, system design, communication, law, governance, epistemology  
**Forms**: vulnerability (noun), vulnerable (adj), vulnerably (adv)

**Depends on**:  
- **resilience@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**  
- **maintenance@1.0.0**  
- **transparency@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Exposure + Impact Potential**: A vulnerability always includes both a point of exposure and a plausible negative outcome.

- **Contextual**: A term or system may be vulnerable only **in certain domains**, **timescales**, or **interaction types**.

- **Exploitability**: A vulnerability becomes **critical** when it can be predictably or silently **abused**‚Äîby bad actors or by failure of structure.

- **Inverse of Fortification**: Where resilience represents capacity to absorb stress, vulnerability reflects the **points of failure** that compromise it.

---

### üöß Exclusions

- **Inherent Softness**: Not all openness or simplicity is vulnerability‚Äîonly when it creates **harm potential** or **exploit surface**.

- **Ignorance Alone**: Being unknown is not necessarily being vulnerable, unless accompanied by lack of defensive context or care.

- **Provisional Weakness**: Controlled exposure for testing, empathy, or negotiation is not counted as vulnerability unless unmanaged.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
Unaddressed vulnerabilities can be **used to manipulate meaning**, **capture interpretation**, **rewrite intention**, or **disable systems silently**.

Examples:
- A term left undefined becomes a vector for judicial capture.  
- A community-driven repository without moderation becomes a site for ideological flooding.  
- A legal concept with conflicting definitions becomes a liability for selective enforcement.

### üîÅ Variants

- `vulnerability.semantic`: A definition or expression susceptible to reinterpretation, hijack, or contradiction.

- `vulnerability.legal`: Legal language that allows **loopholes**, **unclear protections**, or **contradictory outcomes**.

- `vulnerability.technical`: Systemic or infrastructural gaps that enable **data manipulation**, **loss of integrity**, or **interpretive ambiguity**.

- `vulnerability.social`: Gaps in communication, cultural framing, or representation that allow **disenfranchisement** or **exclusion**.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Audit Required**: All high-impact terms or structures must undergo **vulnerability audit** for exploit paths and ambiguity vectors.

- **Version Visibility**: Vulnerability notes must be **linked to term versions**, especially when mitigated or patched.

- **Safeguard Protocols**: Defined roles (human or AI) may be assigned as **semantic custodians** to monitor exposure and apply mitigation.

- **Disclosure & Correction**: Vulnerabilities must be **openly disclosed**, tagged, and placed in resolution queues. Silent persistence is not permitted.
