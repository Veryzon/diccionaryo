# Term: coherence

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Coherence** is the property of a structure, system, or expression in which all parts **align logically, semantically, and functionally** with each other and with the whole. In Logotecture, coherence is essential to **semantic stability**, **interpretative consistency**, and the **reliability of frameworks**—from single terms to legal codes.

**Domain**: semantics, logic, governance, discourse theory, information systems  
**Forms**: coherence (noun), coherent (adj), cohere (verb), incoherence (antonym)

**Depends on**:  
- **consistency@1.0.0**  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **sanity@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Internal Alignment**: Components (terms, rules, ideas) do not contradict each other within the same system.

- **Semantic Harmony**: Meanings are **non-conflicting and mutually reinforcing**, forming a stable interpretation space.

- **Flow of Logic**: Arguments or explanations **progress naturally** without breaks, tangents, or reversals.

- **Frame Integrity**: Coherence protects the boundary of a system—**keeping out distortive influences** while preserving adaptability.

- **Holistic Integration**: New elements (rules, definitions, facts) fit into existing systems **without causing structural contradiction**.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Superficial Consistency**: Just because something appears logically ordered doesn't mean it's coherent; it may lack **semantic or ethical alignment**.

- **Enforced Uniformity**: Coherence is not sameness—it allows **variation**, so long as the core principles are not violated.

- **Narrative-Only Flow**: A story may feel emotionally coherent but may still lack logical or factual integrity.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Medium–High.  
- Coherence is often **claimed to avoid criticism**—e.g., “the system makes sense internally” while refusing to engage outside scrutiny.

Invalid examples:
- “This ideology is coherent” → If based on **circular logic or untestable assumptions**, it may be **internally enclosed but semantically brittle**.
- “The plan is coherent because it’s all written down” → Formality ≠ coherence. All parts must align in meaning and function.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `coherence.semantic`: All terms and references maintain **stable, inter-compatible meaning**.

- `coherence.logical`: Arguments unfold **without contradiction or leaps**.

- `coherence.systemic`: Rules and components work together to form a **non-fragmented whole**.

- `coherence.discursive`: Public or legal discourse remains **traceable and structurally aligned**, even when views differ.

- `coherence.procedural`: Steps and outcomes **match declared goals**, forming **an intelligible, reviewable process**.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Layered Coherence**: Coherence must apply across **micro (term)**, **meso (clause/system)**, and **macro (principle/goal)** levels.

- **Auditable Reconciliation**: If contradictions are found, the framework must provide **pathways for conflict resolution** without collapse.

- **Coherence vs Dogma**: Avoid mistaking resistance to change for stability. **Coherence must accommodate justified evolution**.
