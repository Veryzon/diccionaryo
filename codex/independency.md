### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Autonomy**: The ability to make decisions or take actions without external interference. True **independency** allows individuals or institutions to act according to their own judgment, free from pressure or coercion.
- **Self-sufficiency**: Independence is marked by the ability to sustain one's own operations, resources, and decision-making processes without relying on outside influence or support.
- **Objectivity**: Independence ensures that decisions are based on objective facts, criteria, and reasoning, rather than personal interests, external biases, or conflicts of interest.
- **Freedom from Coercion**: An independent entity or individual must be free from **external control** or **manipulation**, ensuring that their choices are made based on their own principles, free from undue influence.

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **External Influence**: **Independency** is compromised when external forces, such as **political pressure**, **financial incentives**, or **social influence**, manipulate or control decisions.
- **Dependency**: Relying on another party or system for resources, power, or influence undermines true **independency**. This includes both **financial dependency** and **social dependency**.
- **Coercion**: Any form of **coercion**—whether physical, financial, or emotional—compromises **independence** by limiting free choice and autonomy.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Medium to High.  
- **Independency** is vulnerable to sideloading when powerful interests or external forces subtly or overtly influence decisions, even when they appear to be independent. This is especially problematic in **legal systems**, **media**, and **political institutions**.
- **Financial dependency** or **political allegiance** can lead to a lack of true **independence**, resulting in biased or skewed outcomes.

Invalid examples:
- “The judge accepted a large sum of money from a political party, while still claiming to be **independent**” → true **independency** is undermined when **financial influence** affects decisions.
- “The media outlet presented biased opinions while claiming **independence**” → true **independence** in media requires that the outlet remain free from **external pressures**.
