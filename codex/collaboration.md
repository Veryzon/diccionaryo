# Term: collaboration

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Collaboration** is the structured and intentional act of working jointly with others to achieve a common objective. It involves sharing knowledge, responsibilities, resources, and decision-making in a coordinated manner. Unlike parallel work or simple cooperation, **collaboration** requires interdependence among participants, built upon mutual respect, communication, and collective ownership of outcomes. It is a key pillar for innovation, resilience, and legitimacy in systems that depend on more than one actor.

**Domain**: social, organizational, educational, technical, political

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Mutual Purpose**: At its core, collaboration is purpose-driven. All collaborators share a goal or intent, and their efforts are coordinated to reach that goal. The purpose may be fixed (e.g. finishing a project) or adaptive (e.g. ongoing research), but it always requires a shared orientation.

- **Complementarity**: **Collaboration** involves leveraging diverse strengths. Participants bring different skills, insights, or resources, and the structure allows these differences to synergize rather than conflict. It's a way to assemble capabilities across individuals or entities in a productive alignment.

- **Joint Ownership**: Results of true collaboration are co-owned. This means that success or failure is shared, and no one actor claims disproportionate credit or responsibility. This shared accountability builds stronger commitment to outcomes and reinforces fairness.

- **Interdependence**: Collaboration implies that actors rely on each other‚Äînot just work in parallel. This interdependence encourages tighter feedback loops, collective reflection, and a more iterative, adaptive process of producing results.

- **Co-Creation and Dialogue**: Communication in collaboration is not one-way or transactional; it is dialogical. Ideas are built together. This makes collaboration especially powerful for innovation, conflict resolution, and systemic change.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Coordination Alone**: Merely assigning roles or managing workflows isn‚Äôt collaboration. For example, a set of workers performing separate tasks under instruction is coordination, not collaboration‚Äîunless they influence each other‚Äôs choices or outcomes meaningfully.

- **Forced or Unequal Partnerships**: When power asymmetry is too high and participation is not equitable, **collaboration** may become extractive. This invalidates the mutual and co-creative nature of true collaboration.

- **Token Involvement**: Including stakeholders only symbolically‚Äîwithout giving them real influence‚Äîis a form of false collaboration and can cause long-term erosion of trust.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Moderate to high.  
- **Sideloading** of **collaboration** occurs when it is used as a rhetorical label to obscure hierarchy, coercion, or centralized control. Projects may claim to be collaborative while one party retains total decision-making power or captures most benefits.

Invalid examples:
- "A tech platform declares its product 'collaboratively built' even though it controls all final decisions and data outcomes." ‚Üí **Pretend collaboration**.
- "Government consults communities about new infrastructure but ignores all feedback in final planning." ‚Üí **Simulated collaboration**.

### üîÅ Variants

- `collaboration.peer`: Involves individuals or groups of equal standing working together, such as researchers, teams within an organization, or activists in a movement.

- `collaboration.cross-sector`: Between actors from different domains, such as public-private partnerships or academic-industry research collaborations.

- `collaboration.digitized`: Uses online tools, platforms, and communication systems to coordinate work across geographic or temporal boundaries.

- `collaboration.intercultural`: Between individuals or groups from different cultural backgrounds. Requires extra attention to communication norms, assumptions, and values.

- `collaboration.institutional`: Formalized collaboration between institutions (e.g., universities, governments, NGOs) with defined responsibilities and governance.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Collaborative Governance**: A governance model that includes multiple stakeholders (citizens, public officials, NGOs, etc.) in decision-making. It values transparency, joint responsibility, and negotiated outcomes.

- **Collaborative Lawmaking**: Emerging practices in which citizens or interest groups actively shape legislative drafts or regulatory frameworks. Collaboration in this context supports legitimacy and relevance of law.

- **Institutional Memory and Documentation**: In collaborative settings, it is crucial to document agreements, conflicts, and outcomes so future collaborators understand the foundation on which they build.
