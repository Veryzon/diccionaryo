### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Autonomy in Decision-Making**: The **freedom** to choose reflects an individual‚Äôs **control** over their own **life** and **actions**, impacting their **agency** and self-determination.

- **Evaluation of Alternatives**: Choice is based on **weighing** different options, each presenting distinct potential outcomes. This process is guided by personal **values**, **desires**, and available **information**.

- **External and Internal Constraints**: Choice can be influenced by **external pressures** (e.g., societal norms, legal restrictions) or **internal factors** (e.g., values, preferences, biases). It may also be constrained by **economic** or **resource limitations**.

- **Moral and Ethical Dimensions**: Choices often carry **moral weight**, where decisions may affect others. Ethical systems may dictate what is considered a **right** or **wrong** choice in a given context.

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Choice ‚â† Freedom from Consequences**: Making a choice often involves facing **consequences**, whether positive or negative. True freedom in choice does not exclude the responsibility of dealing with its **outcomes**.

- **Choice ‚â† Lack of Influence**: While **choice** implies freedom, it is often shaped by **external influences** like culture, education, or **advertising**, which can subtly influence how **choices** are framed.

- **Choice ‚â† Unlimited Options**: Having a **choice** does not imply unlimited alternatives. It often exists within a system of **constraints**, including **resources**, **time**, and **social context**.

- **Choice ‚â† Indifference**: A choice implies active **preference** or **decision-making**, unlike a state of indifference or **neutrality**, where no decision is made.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**Moderate**, as **choice** can sometimes be manipulated or restricted by those with power, **narrowing options** to make the choice appear more **free** than it is. 

- **Limited Alternatives**: In some systems, the **range of choice** can be deliberately limited by **economic, social**, or **political forces**, giving the illusion of choice without providing real options.

- **Framing Effect**: How choices are **presented** or framed (through language or media) can skew the perceived **value** of each alternative, impacting decision-making without a true **evaluation** of options.

- **Information Asymmetry**: Choice can be manipulated when **critical information** is withheld, **obfuscated**, or **distorted**, leading to decisions that do not reflect the full scope of possibilities.

- **False Dichotomies**: In certain contexts, only two options may be presented when a broader set of alternatives exists, limiting the actual freedom of choice.
