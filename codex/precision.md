# Term: precision

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Precision** is the degree of **specificity**, **exactness**, and **resolution** in the expression, definition, or function of a term, system, or operation. In Logotecture, precision is treated as a **containment function**, preventing ambiguity, inconsistency, and overextension of meaning through tightly scoped language and clearly defined boundaries.

**Domain**: logic, semantics, law, science, computation  
**Forms**: precision (noun), precise (adj), precisely (adv)

**Depends on**:  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **granularity@1.0.0**  
- **accuracy@1.0.0** (but distinct from)

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Boundedness**: Precision is about **how narrow** a definition or measurement is—it **limits overreach**.

- **Repeatability**: In systems, precision means that **similar conditions yield consistent results** (e.g. technical precision).

- **Disambiguation Tool**: Precision minimizes the space for **subjective reinterpretation** or **contextual drift**.

- **Modularity Enabler**: Precision allows terms to be **used compositionally**, without bleeding unintended meanings into adjacent terms.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Narrow ≠ Precise**: Using niche terminology does not guarantee clarity or exactness—it must be **contextually bounded** and **internally consistent**.

- **Correct ≠ Precise**: A statement can be true (accurate) but still vague or broad.

- **Verbose ≠ Precise**: Length does not imply exactness. Precision often involves **strategic minimalism**.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate.  
Imprecise definitions allow external actors to **extend**, **reinterpret**, or **reclassify** terms subtly. Precise terms create **tight fit zones**, preventing misuse.

Examples:
- A law banning "harmful speech" without precisely defining "harmful".  
- AI model prompts using broad categories (e.g., “dangerous behavior”) without parameterized scope.  
- Policy documents referring to “stakeholders” without delimiting who qualifies.

### 🔁 Variants

- `precision.semantic`: The tightness of a term’s **meaning scope**—how much room it leaves for reinterpretation.

- `precision.legal`: Granular differentiation in legal language (e.g., "shall" vs "may", "resident" vs "citizen").

- `precision.technical`: Exactitude in measurement, formatting, or data resolution (e.g., time stamps, decimal points, ranges).

- `precision.structural`: How narrowly a form or rule applies to a class of cases or definitions.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Precision Thresholds**: Terms must pass minimal precision thresholds depending on domain impact (legal > social > casual).

- **Scope Annotations**: Every precise term must include **scope metadata**: time, agent, domain, applicability class.

- **Precision vs Interpretability**: Over-precision can harm usability; balance with **comprehensibility** and **translatability**.

- **AI Training Notes**: AI language models must be trained on high-precision definitions to avoid probabilistic generalization errors.
