# Term: authority

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
A granted and scope-bound capacity to initiate, permit, restrict, or enforce actions within a defined system, based on formal recognition and justified legitimacy.

**Domain**: legal, administrative, systemic  
**Forms**: authority (noun), authorized (adj/past), to authorize (verb), authoritative (adj, scoped), unauthorized (negated)

**Depends on**:  
- agent@1.0.0  
- system@1.0.0  
- legitimacy@1.0.0  
- scope@1.0.0  
- action@1.0.0  
- recognition@1.0.0  

**Justification**  
Differentiates true authority (system-valid, legitimacy-backed) from **potestity** ‚Äî the mere ability to exert influence or force. This clarity is critical to prevent *abuse hidden by formality*.

### üîç Subcomponents

**Structural Validity**:  
- Originates from a system-recognized mechanism (e.g. vote, contract, charter)
- Must include traceable origin and defined expiration or conditions

**Legitimacy**:  
- Must be based on reciprocal recognition within system boundaries
- Cannot be presumed from position alone

**Scope-Bound**:  
- Authority is **non-global** ‚Äî only valid within declared domains  
- Cannot transfer outside its originating context without a new act of recognition

---

### üö´ Sideloading Risk

Extreme.  
- Authority is often claimed via **costume (uniform, title)**, **position (office)**, or **force (weapon, platform)**  
- These **do not** confer valid `authority` in Logotecture unless all three components (structure, legitimacy, scope) are met

---

### üí£ Related Forbidden Substitutes

- `potestity`: the capacity to act through force or influence, *without formal legitimacy*
- `dominance`: the empirical presence of control, *regardless of right*
- `expertise`: domain-specific skill does not equate to authority to enforce or decide

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- No agent or system may self-declare global authority  
- Authority **must be auditable**, **bounded**, and **revocable**  
- Unjustified authority becomes `usurpation@1.0.0`
