### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Non-alignment**: Neutrality requires refraining from **aligning** with one party or viewpoint, remaining **independent** and free from external pressures or influences.
- **Objectivity**: A neutral position must be based on **objective reasoning** and **facts**, rather than personal preferences, political views, or societal trends.
- **Independence**: Neutrality necessitates an **independent** stance, ensuring that decisions are made without external interference or the influence of dominant parties or stakeholders.
- **Absence of Bias**: Neutrality ensures there is no **partiality** or **favoritism**, and that all perspectives are given equal consideration without a predetermined outcome.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Bias**: Neutrality is compromised when decisions are influenced by **personal bias**, **ideological leanings**, or the interests of a particular group. A **biased** approach will result in a lack of neutrality.
- **Partisanship**: Supporting a particular side in a conflict, debate, or issue violates neutrality. Neutrality requires detachment from **partisan** interests, maintaining an objective stance.
- **Involvement in Conflict**: In conflicts, neutrality means abstaining from taking part in the conflict itself‚Äîwhether politically, militarily, or socially.
- **Favoritism**: Giving preferential treatment or showing a clear preference for one side undermines neutrality, making it impossible to remain neutral in the situation.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Medium to High.  
- **Neutrality** is prone to sideloading when external forces, like political pressure, financial incentives, or personal biases, infiltrate the decision-making process, influencing outcomes.
- **Compromise of neutrality** may also happen when institutions or individuals claim neutrality but secretly support one side, rendering their neutrality a **facade**.

Invalid examples:
- "The judge ruled based on personal belief, though claiming to be neutral" ‚Üí a **judge** must base decisions on law, not personal belief or external influence.
- ‚ÄúThe mediator consistently sides with one party during negotiations, even though they claim to be neutral‚Äù ‚Üí true neutrality requires the mediator to be **fair** to both sides, avoiding **favoritism**.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Active Neutrality**: Maintaining neutrality isn't just about abstaining from involvement, but also ensuring that neutrality is actively preserved by avoiding any actions or decisions that would bias the situation.
- **Recusal**: In cases where neutrality might be compromised, a system should have provisions for **recusal**, ensuring that individuals or organizations with vested interests step aside to avoid influencing the outcome.
- **Legitimacy of Neutrality**: It's important that the claim of neutrality is transparent and well-communicated. Without clear justification for maintaining neutrality, the process or decision-making may be perceived as insincere or untrustworthy.
- **Neutrality in Conflict**: In some instances, especially in **conflict resolution**, neutrality may require offering a **platform for dialogue** and ensuring that all parties have an **equal opportunity to express their views** and seek a resolution.
