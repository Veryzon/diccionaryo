### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Compulsion**: Enforcement requires the **use of authority** to ensure compliance with a rule, law, or agreement. This may involve consequences, penalties, or corrective actions.
- **Consistency**: Enforcement ensures that decisions and actions are applied **uniformly**, ensuring that no individual or entity is above the law or rules.
- **Monitoring**: Effective enforcement relies on **continuous monitoring** to ensure that compliance is ongoing and any violations are detected in a timely manner.
- **Sanctions**: Enforcement often involves imposing **sanctions** or consequences for non-compliance, ranging from fines and penalties to more serious actions, like legal action or termination of rights.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Selective Enforcement**: Enforcement cannot be biased or selective. It must be applied **equally** to all parties without favoritism, ensuring that **justice** is not compromised.
- **Unenforced Laws**: A law or rule that is not **enforced** is often **ineffective**, leading to **impunity** and undermining trust in the system.
- **Overreach**: While enforcement is necessary, it must not exceed the limits of its **legitimate authority** or become **coercive** to the point of undermining individual freedoms or rights.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

- **Enforcement** can be distorted or **sideloaded** if used for **personal or political gain**. Powerful entities or individuals may attempt to **misuse enforcement** to target opponents, suppress dissent, or favor specific groups.

- ‚ÄúThe penalties for breaking the law are **inconsistent**, depending on who you are‚Äù ‚Üí enforcement requires **consistency** and **equality**.
- ‚ÄúThe enforcement agency is **silent** on certain violations but quick to act on others‚Äù ‚Üí transparency in **enforcement** decisions is critical to maintaining **legitimacy**.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Due Process**: Effective enforcement must adhere to **due process**, ensuring that the **rights** of individuals are not violated in the process of enforcing laws or agreements.
- **Accountability**: Those who carry out enforcement actions must be **accountable** for their conduct and decisions. **Abuse of power** within enforcement can undermine the system‚Äôs **credibility** and **legitimacy**.
- **Proportionality**: Enforcement should be proportional to the violation. Overly harsh penalties for minor violations can lead to **discontent**, while **leniency** can result in **disregard** for the system.
