# Term: ambiguity

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Ambiguity** is the presence of **two or more plausible interpretations** for a term, phrase, structure, or system, caused by a lack of precision, insufficient context, or overlap of meaning. In Logotecture, ambiguity is considered a **semantic instability** that must be **flagged**, **contextualized**, or **resolved** depending on its potential for distortion or misuse.

**Domain**: semantics, logic, law, communication, AI reasoning  
**Forms**: ambiguity (noun), ambiguous (adj), ambiguously (adv)

**Conflicts with**:  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **precision@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**  
- **predictability@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Polysemy**: A word or structure having multiple accepted meanings (e.g., “right” = direction, entitlement, correctness).

- **Context Dependence**: Meaning shifts based on external, often **undefined** or **unstated**, factors.

- **Structural Ambiguity**: Grammatical or syntactical design allows **multiple parsing paths** (common in contracts, policy, and AI prompts).

- **Intent Veil**: Ambiguity may **hide or defer** responsibility by making intention undecidable or deniable.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Controlled Flexibility**: Strategic ambiguity used in diplomacy, negotiation, or poetic expression may be valid when clearly scoped.

- **Cultural Resonance**: Some ambiguity reflects necessary plurality in lived experience (e.g., metaphor, irony) and may be annotated, not removed.

- **Machine Interpretation Layer**: Logotecture distinguishes between ambiguity in **human comprehension** and **machine parsing**—only unflagged ambiguity in both is critical.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Very High.  
Ambiguity is the most **commonly exploited vulnerability** for **reinterpretation**, **selective enforcement**, or **ideological smuggling**.

Examples:
- A law protecting “citizens” vs. “people” vs. “residents” ambiguously, enabling arbitrary inclusion or exclusion.  
- A term like “freedom” left undefined allows radical divergence between libertarian, authoritarian, or economic readings.  
- Ambiguity in AI prompt instructions leads to **nonsensical or biased outputs** due to internal interpretive branching.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `ambiguity.legal`: Any term, clause, or condition in legal text whose interpretation is contestable or contradictory.

- `ambiguity.semantic`: Core definitional terms with **unstable boundaries** or **fluid usage** across domains.

- `ambiguity.syntactic`: Phrases or logic that allow **structural misreading**—especially dangerous in code, contracts, or AI logic.

- `ambiguity.pragmatic`: Terms where **speaker intent** or **social context** is essential to resolve meaning but not supplied.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Flag and Resolve**: Ambiguity must be flagged at term submission or usage. Some ambiguity may be retained if justified and scoped.

- **Resolution Pathing**: Each flagged ambiguity must have either:  
  - **clarification** (definition narrowed),  
  - **context tagging** (restricted to domain or usage), or  
  - **deprecation** (if irreconcilable).

- **AI Awareness**: AI systems must be trained to detect ambiguity vectors and request **context injection** when ambiguity blocks clarity.
