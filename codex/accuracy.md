# Term: accuracy

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Accuracy** is the degree to which a definition, statement, representation, or output corresponds **faithfully** to its **intended reference**, **factual source**, or **systemic target**. In Logotecture, accuracy is treated as a **measurement of semantic fidelity**, used to validate the reliability of terms, knowledge, or actions in both human and machine systems.

**Domain**: epistemology, measurement, law, AI reasoning, semantics  
**Forms**: accuracy (noun), accurate (adj), accurately (adv)

**Depends on**:  
- **truth@1.0.0**  
- **clarity@1.0.0**  
- **context@1.0.0**  
- **intent@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Reference-Centered**: Accuracy is judged relative to an **established truth source**, observation, or reference model.

- **Fidelity, not Absolutism**: Accuracy is not "being right at all times", but **minimizing deviation** from what was known or intended.

- **Non-Subjective** (in most cases): While perceptions may vary, accuracy seeks **verifiable alignment** with agreed standards or facts.

- **Distinction from Precision**: Precision refers to **specificity and repeatability**; accuracy refers to **correctness** or **truth-matching**.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Consensus ≠ Accuracy**: Agreement among people does not validate a fact as accurate if the reference is misaligned or biased.

- **Sincerity ≠ Accuracy**: A statement can be made in good faith and still be inaccurate. **Intent is tracked separately**.

- **Clarity ≠ Accuracy**: A message can be clear yet inaccurate, and vice versa.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate to High.  
The term “accurate” is often used **subjectively** or **rhetorically** without clarifying the reference. This creates room for **truth distortion**, **data misuse**, or **redefinition by authority**.

Examples:
- Declaring data “accurate” based on selective sampling.  
- A legal term claimed as “accurately interpreted” without evidentiary or historical basis.  
- AI outputs labeled “accurate” without clear grounding in the defined dataset or semantic model.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `accuracy.semantic`: Alignment between a term and its **agreed definition or etymological basis**.

- `accuracy.factual`: Alignment between a statement and **observable or recorded reality**.

- `accuracy.operational`: A system's ability to produce **correct outcomes** under defined conditions.

- `accuracy.legal`: Degree to which interpretation aligns with **documented legislative intent**, precedent, or constitutionality.

- `accuracy.technical`: Measurable closeness between output and expected value (e.g., in measurements, predictions).

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Reference Linking**: All statements marked as “accurate” must point to the **reference object**, **dataset**, or **intent source**.

- **Dispute Protocol**: Accuracy disputes must be evaluated via **traceable context**, not opinion or volume of repetition.

- **AI Constraints**: Systems must differentiate between **high-confidence output** and **verified accurate output**, and disclose that difference.

- **Version Mapping**: Accuracy may vary across versions of knowledge or law—must be anchored to timestamped snapshots.
