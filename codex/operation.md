# Term: operation

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
An **operation** is an **executed unit or flow of activity**, composed of one or more **tactics or procedures**, intended to produce a **predictable, verifiable result** under specific **rules, protocols, or strategies**, and typically supported by **tools, actors, or systems**.

**Domain**: systems architecture, governance, software, logistics, legal mechanics  
**Forms**: operation (n), operational (adj), operate (v), operator (n), operable (adj)

**Depends on**:  
- **strategy@1.0.0**  
- **tactic@1.0.0**  
- **procedure@1.0.0**  
- **system@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Executable Logic**: Operations are **intended to be run**, either by human agents or machines, according to defined steps.

- **Outcome-Oriented**: Must produce **observable effects**, with potential for **validation or failure detection**.

- **Repeatability**: A valid operation should be **reproducible under equivalent inputs**, unless explicitly marked as non-repeatable.

- **Boundedness**: Operations **declare entry, flow, and exit states**, often governed by **permission and context**.

---

### 🚫 Exclusions

- **Operation ≠ Intuition**: Cannot be solely internal or undefined by rules.

- **Operation ≠ Event**: Events may occur passively; operations require **intent and systemic placement**.

- **Operation ≠ Strategy**: Operations are the **mechanics of enactment**, not the planning logic.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `operation.semantic`: Parsing, transforming, or validating language within logotectural constraints.

- `operation.legal`: Enforcing, applying, or nullifying legal constructs using procedural mechanics.

- `operation.technical`: Any system-executable command, including **automated actions or scripts**.

- `operation.audit`: A designed process to **validate behavior, performance, or compliance**.

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

**Moderate**, due to common overuse in military or covert contexts, and abstraction in bureaucratic systems.

- **Obfuscation Risk**: Operations may be **used to hide intent** or **split accountability** through procedural layering.

- **Dehumanized Framing**: High-risk or ethically questionable actions are often euphemized as “operations.”

- **Disconnection from Strategy**: Repetitive or inherited operations may **persist after goals have changed.**

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Operational Ledgering**: Every operation affecting shared assets must be **loggable and auditable**.

- **Authorization Layer**: Operations should only run under **clearly defined roles or identity tokens**.

- **Rollback Conditions**: All non-trivial operations must declare **expected reversibility or cleanup** steps.

- **Fail State Documentation**: Expected **failures and triggers** should be declared in operation metadata.

---

### 🌍 Why This Matters in Practice

- **Legal Enforceability**: Legal systems function through defined operations—**registration, filing, judgment, appeal**.

- **Language Clarity**: Semantic clarity requires **transformational operations** (e.g., derivation, negation, validation).

- **Cyber-Governance**: AI or autonomous tools must operate only within **sanctioned operation sets**.

- **Civil Trust**: Institutions gain trust not just through intention, but by **transparent and consistent operations**.

### ⚙️ In Logotecture

- **Core Mechanism**: Logotecture is composed of layered operations—**from term insertion to rule enforcement**.

- **Contributor Gatekeeping**: User actions (submitting, reviewing, rejecting terms) are structured as **auditable operations**.

- **Operational Design Language**: All operations must include **inputs, rules, outcomes, and references**.

- **Operation Template**: Future contributions should declare:
  - `operation.id`
  - `operation.context`
  - `inputs_required`
  - `permissible_roles`
  - `outputs_expected`
  - `linked_strategy_id`
