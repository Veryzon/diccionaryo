# Term: agency

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Agency** is the capacity of an individual or collective to act intentionally, make choices, and influence outcomes within a given system. It is the exercise of will, decision-making, and self-direction, grounded in awareness, access, and ability. Agency is not only personal‚Äîit can be systemic, shared, constrained, or resisted‚Äîbut it always involves the potential to shape reality rather than be solely shaped by it.

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Intentionality**: At its core, **agency** involves purposeful action. The actor is aware of their choice and directs it toward an intended outcome, whether it succeeds or not.

- **Self-Determination**: Agency affirms the ability to make decisions for oneself, even in the presence of social, cultural, or institutional constraints.

- **Effectiveness**: True agency includes not only the will to act but the potential to affect change‚Äîhowever minor‚Äîwithin one's environment or system.

- **Responsibility**: With agency comes the link to **accountability**. An agent is generally responsible for their actions when they have acted with awareness and intent.

- **Situational Nature**: Agency is always contextual. It may be expanded, restricted, or manipulated depending on structures of power, access to knowledge, or psychological state.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Automated or Conditioned Behavior**: Agency does not apply to involuntary reactions, deeply conditioned reflexes, or behavior absent of conscious direction.

- **Forced Action**: Acts performed under coercion or duress do not fully express agency, even if they involve movement or decision. Agency is tied to autonomy.

- **Passive Existence**: Merely existing or being affected by systems does not constitute agency unless there is an element of self-directed response.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
- **Agency** is often claimed or attributed rhetorically to avoid responsibility for oppression or disempowerment. For example, systems that coerce compliance may say "people had agency to choose" while removing all viable alternatives.

Invalid examples:
- "An employee can quit any time, so they consent to poor conditions." ‚Üí This ignores **structural constraints** on agency.
- "People choose misinformation; it‚Äôs their agency." ‚Üí Fails to account for manipulation or disempowerment through controlled access to truth.

### üîÅ Variants

- `agency.personal`: Individual capacity to make decisions and initiate actions in one's own life. Tied to self-awareness, autonomy, and internal empowerment.

- `agency.collective`: A group‚Äôs shared ability to coordinate and act together in pursuit of common goals. It is not just the sum of individual agency but often stronger through solidarity.

- `agency.structural`: Institutional or systemic configuration of power that enables or restricts agents from acting. Recognizes how structures can support or suppress agency.

- `agency.legal`: The recognized capacity to act on behalf of oneself or others within a legal system, often tied to concepts like representation, guardianship, or legal personality.

- `agency.reclaimed`: Refers to acts where individuals or groups actively reassert agency in spaces or systems where it was denied or diminished.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Agency vs. Control**: Agency does not mean control over all variables; it means the presence of intentional action within constraint. Systems that support agency do not eliminate boundaries but make choice meaningful.

- **In Systems of Power**: Recognizing or denying agency is a political act. Granting agency can be empowering; denying it can justify coercion or paternalism. Governance frameworks must carefully distinguish between protecting agents and infantilizing them.

- **Agency and Law**: In legal terms, agency also refers to acting on behalf of another. This is different from the philosophical definition, but intersects in debates over consent, representation, and responsibility.
