### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Credentialing**: Qualifications are often **certificates or proof of expertise** or competence in a specific field (e.g., professional degrees, licenses).

- **Verifiability**: A qualification can be **tracked, confirmed**, and **linked to recognized sources** (e.g., accreditation bodies, certifying authorities).

- **Contextual**: Qualifications are **context-dependent**‚Äîwhat qualifies someone in one domain or scenario may not in another (e.g., a medical license does not qualify someone to act as a legal professional).

- **Standardized**: Qualifications must be **clearly defined** and **measurable** so that any individual can ascertain what is necessary to meet them.

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Qualification ‚â† Self-Declared**: Simply stating oneself as "qualified" does not suffice. **Verification and evidence** are key.

- **Qualification ‚â† Arbitrary**: Qualifications cannot be **based on personal biases or unreasoned standards**. They must adhere to **objective criteria**.

- **Qualification ‚â† Generic**: Qualifications must be **role-specific** and not universally applied inappropriately across all fields.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**Medium to High**.  
Qualification can be **manipulated**, where individuals or entities might claim credentials, experience, or expertise without meeting **objective standards**. Logotecture emphasizes that any qualification must be **explicitly verified** and **testable**.

Examples:
- **Fake diplomas** or certifications used to gain access to positions of power.
- **Overinflated resumes** where claimed qualifications cannot be substantiated.
- **Misuse of ambiguous credentials** to make unqualified individuals appear legitimate.
