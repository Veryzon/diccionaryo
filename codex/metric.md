# Term: metric

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Metric** is a **standardized measure or parameter** used to quantify, compare, or evaluate specific aspects of an object, action, performance, process, or system, allowing for **objective assessment** and **decision-making**.

**Domain**: measurement, evaluation, systems, governance, accountability, optimization  
**Forms**: metric (noun), metrics (plural), metrical (adj)

**Depends on**:  
- **measurement@1.0.0**  
- **assessment@1.0.0**  
- **criteria@1.0.0**  
- **quantifiability@1.0.0**  
- **evidence@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Quantifiable**: A metric must be **expressible in units**, values, scores, ratios, or categories that allow for comparison and analysis.

- **Standardized**: A metric has a **defined structure and meaning**, making it interoperable across **systems** and **contexts**.

- **Purpose-Specific**: Metrics are often **domain-bound**, created to measure specific goals (e.g., efficiency, fairness, cost, impact, reliability).

- **Evaluative**: Metrics help determine whether **performance** or **conditions** meet expectations, goals, or legal/ethical thresholds.

- **Comparable**: Metrics must enable **comparison over time**, between entities, or across situations to be meaningful.

### üö´ Exclusions

- **Metric ‚â† General Data**: A metric is not any data point. It is **structured, interpretable data** tied to a **goal or criteria**.

- **Metric ‚â† Value Statement**: A metric describes **what is**, not **what should be**. Interpretation and contextualization provide meaning, not the metric alone.

- **Metric ‚â† Judgment**: A metric informs **judgment**, but it is not a judgment itself‚Äîit must be connected to **criteria** or **evaluation frameworks**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

**High**, especially in **governance**, **legal**, or **economic** systems.  
Metrics are often **assumed to be neutral**, but they can be:

- **Cherry-picked** to reinforce desired narratives  
- **Designed to favor certain outcomes** (e.g. biased performance indicators)  
- **Detached from meaningful impact**, creating false signals of success or fairness  
- **Misinterpreted** due to poor context, granularity, or alignment with goals

---

### üîÅ Variants

- `metric.performance`: Measures output or achievement (e.g. productivity, success rate)

- `metric.compliance`: Measures alignment with rules, laws, or expectations

- `metric.efficiency`: Compares input vs output in systems

- `metric.fairness`: Attempts to quantify **equality of treatment** or **distribution of benefit**

- `metric.risk`: Attempts to quantify uncertainty, exposure, or vulnerability

- `metric.sentiment`: Quantifies perception or psychological states (e.g. approval, trust, satisfaction)

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Metric Design**: All metrics must declare their **origin**, **formula**, and **limits of applicability**. Transparency prevents covert manipulations.

- **Metric Saturation**: Too many metrics can dilute clarity. Systems must guard against **over-metricization**, which replaces judgment with uncritical scoring.

- **Metric Misalignment**: Metrics must be linked to **true goals**, not superficial proxies. Misaligned metrics lead to **counterproductive behavior**.

- **Metric Revision**: Metrics must be **reviewed regularly** to ensure they reflect **current conditions** and **system priorities**.

### üåç Why This Matters in Practice

- Metrics enable **AI and automated systems** to participate in **judgment**, **assessment**, and **governance** by providing **interpretable input**.

- Without trustworthy metrics, systems collapse into **subjectivity**, **bias**, or **inefficiency**.

- In **Logotecture**, metrics are never used blindly‚Äîthey are **tied to traceable definitions**, **ethical validation**, and **domain-specific criteria**.
