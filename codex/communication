# Term: communication

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Communication** is the intentional or unintentional transmission of information from one agent to another, resulting in interpretation, reaction, or shared understanding. It requires a sender, a medium, a message, and a receiver—along with a system of encoding and decoding that allows meaning to be carried and recognized. Communication is both a technical process and a semantic/social act.

**Domain**: linguistics, computing, sociology, psychology, systems theory  
**Forms**: communication (noun), communicate (verb), communicative (adj), communicator (noun)

**Depends on**:

- **language@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Bidirectional Potential**: Even when initiated one-way, communication often implies **feedback**, correction, or clarification. It is a **relational** process.

- **Medium-Dependent**: It uses various channels—text, speech, visual, gestural, digital—each with strengths, limitations, and cultural dependencies.

- **Encoded and Interpreted**: Meaning is **not in the message itself**, but in the alignment between encoding (by the sender) and decoding (by the receiver). Misalignment leads to misunderstanding.

- **Semantic Load**: Communication is **not** just transmission—it also conveys values, tone, intent, emotion, and context.

- **Context-Sensitive**: The same signal may communicate different meanings in different settings. Communication relies heavily on shared or assumed context.

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Raw Emission**: Broadcasting without a plausible receiver or without structured encoding isn’t communication—it’s output or signal spam.

- **Noise**: Interference or distortion may carry energy but not meaning; thus, it’s not communication unless some intended interpretation persists.

- **Perfect Understanding Not Required**: Communication **can occur** even if only partial meaning is shared—but some degree of interpretive alignment must result.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Communication is often claimed as “successful” when only power has been exerted or noise has been repeated. This hides the **failure of comprehension** or **consent**.

Invalid examples:
- “We communicated our decision clearly.” → But if the receiver had no interpretive access (due to jargon, language, exclusion), it wasn’t communication.
- “The law is public, so people are informed.” → Visibility ≠ comprehensibility; mere presence doesn’t equal meaningful communication.

### 🔁 Variants

- `communication.direct`: Unambiguous, clear message from one agent to another with intentionality and minimal interference.

- `communication.indirect`: Relies on implication, context, or cultural inference. Often powerful but prone to misinterpretation.

- `communication.systemic`: Flows within systems—like bureaucracies, legal codes, or technical protocols—where the sender may be distributed or anonymous.

- `communication.symbolic`: Uses signs, metaphors, or archetypes to encode meaning across deeper or layered contexts (e.g. rituals, brand language, protest art).

- `communication.machine`: Digital or AI-mediated communication, where messages may be parsed, generated, or interpreted by non-human agents.

- `communication.failed`: Occurs when intended meaning is blocked, distorted, or interpreted in conflict with the sender’s intent or the system’s assumptions.

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Access =/= Communication**: For policy or legal systems, **true communication** requires not just message availability but **cognitive and linguistic accessibility**.

- **Power in Framing**: Whoever defines the terms of communication (language, platform, allowable formats) shapes what ideas can be shared and understood. This must be openly acknowledged in any semantic justice system.

- **Consent in Communication**: Just because a message was “received” doesn’t mean it was **understood**, **agreed to**, or **engaged with meaningfully**.
