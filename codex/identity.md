# Term: identity

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Identity** is the structured configuration of **traits**, **values**, **attributes**, and **relations** that define a subject (individual, group, object, system, or concept) as **itself**, across **time**, **context**, or **transformation**. In Logotecture, identity must be **verifiable**, **coherent**, and **resilient**‚Äîmaintaining continuity while allowing for adaptive evolution. Identity is the persistent **anchor of recognition**, required to assert meaning, legitimacy, and distinction.

**Domain**: semiotics, governance, systems theory, ethics, language  
**Forms**: identity (noun), identical (adj), identify (verb), identification (n.)

**Depends on**:  
- **continuity@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**  
- **recognizability@1.0.0**  
- **integrity@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Self-Similarity Across Change**: Identity remains **recognizable** even as the entity evolves or adapts. It does not imply immutability, but **core coherence**.

- **Unique Configuration**: Identity arises from a specific and **non-substitutable arrangement** of semantic elements‚Äîwhat it means and how it relates to other terms.

- **Contextual Relevance**: Identity has **meaning only in context**‚Äîa language, a legal system, or a cultural structure. It is never absolute, but always **situated**.

- **Semantic Boundaries**: Identity requires **semantic fences**‚Äîrules about what can and cannot be altered without losing the integrity of the concept or subject.

- **Assertion + Recognition**: Identity is not merely self-defined; it requires **external validation**‚Äîan interplay between **declaration** and **acknowledgment** by others.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Rebranding**: Sudden or arbitrary redefinitions that discard previous structure or traceability do not qualify as identity. These are fabrications or substitutions.

- **Label Substitution**: Replacing a name does not change identity; and inversely, **retaining a name** while altering core meaning creates **semantic deceit**.

- **Anonymous Generality**: If a concept is too vague, disconnected, or non-traceable, it cannot have identity within Logotecture. Identity requires **semantic weight** and **history**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Very High.  
- Identity is **high-value** in political, cultural, and legal contexts. Attempts to **steal**, **duplicate**, **obscure**, or **dilute identity** are frequent tactics of **semantic warfare**, especially through **labels**, **mischaracterizations**, or **legal personhood hacks**.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúWe changed everything but it‚Äôs still the same group‚Äù ‚Üí Not valid without structural, functional, and relational continuity.
- ‚ÄúThis term now includes its opposite too‚Äù ‚Üí Violates the integrity of identity by creating incoherent semantic space.

### üîÅ Variants

- `identity.semantic`: The specific and stable structure of meaning that allows a word or concept to remain **consistent**, even as context evolves. Core to **anti-seizure architecture**.

- `identity.personal`: The self-recognized and socially recognized configuration of **traits**, **roles**, and **beliefs** that define a human subject within a system of rights or narrative.

- `identity.legal`: A defined subject with **status**, **rights**, and **obligations** within a legal or contractual system‚Äîrequires clear attributes and boundaries.

- `identity.institutional`: The formal and operational distinctiveness of an entity (e.g., court, organization) across leadership change, policy shifts, or structural reform.

- `identity.linguistic`: The recognizable **syntax**, **phonology**, and **etymological trace** of a language or dialect, giving it persistence across generations or technological integration.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Verifiable Definitions**: Identity in Logotecture must be built from **verifiable traits**. Assertions of identity without semantic structure can‚Äôt be validated.

- **Identity Over Time**: Each term or system must be **traceable through versioning**, ensuring identity is preserved or clearly forked with justified divergence.

- **Civic Application**: A system that handles individual or group identity must be transparent, secure, and allow **self-auditing**‚Äîso identity can‚Äôt be co-opted or revoked arbitrarily.

- **Preventing Identity Fraud**: Definitions and systems should resist **semantic impersonation** or **conceptual spoofing**, where one concept claims the identity of another for legitimacy or power.
