# Term: documentation

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Documentation** is the structured and persistent recording of **information**, **definitions**, **decisions**, and **rationales** necessary to ensure the **integrity**, **transparency**, and **reusability** of a system or concept. In Logotecture, documentation acts as both **semantic memory** and **governance record**, allowing meanings to be justified, challenged, or inherited with **clear lineage**.

**Domain**: epistemology, systems design, governance, software, linguistics  
**Forms**: documentation (noun), document (noun/verb), documented (adj), documenting (verb)

**Depends on**:  
- **traceability@1.0.0**  
- **recognizability@1.0.0**  
- **continuity@1.0.0**  
- **authority@1.0.0**  
- **revision@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Structural Clarity**: Documentation follows defined **formats**, allowing consistent parsing, comparison, and version control.

- **Justificational Depth**: Each term, system, or decision must carry sufficient **explanation of its purpose, definition, and relation to other elements**.

- **Revision Awareness**: Documentation maintains a **history of changes**, showing what was altered, when, why, and by whom.

- **Referential Function**: Acts as a **point of truth** and reference, especially in systems where meaning must be **stable**, **shared**, or **enforced**.

- **Public Verifiability**: Valid documentation must be **accessible**, **auditable**, and **non-obscure** to qualified readers or agents (human or AI).

---

### üöß Exclusions

- **Obfuscation**: Length or presence does not equal documentation. Documents that hide, distort, or circularly define are disqualified.

- **Unstructured Notes**: Informal comments, speculative thoughts, or private records are not valid documentation unless **formally integrated** and justified.

- **Orphaned Data**: Content without clear reference, purpose, or placement within the system is not documentation‚Äîit is semantic noise.

---

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

Medium.  
- Poor or manipulated documentation can serve to **bury changes**, **fake legitimacy**, or **mask conceptual theft**. When record trails are **non-standard**, **incomplete**, or **non-verifiable**, they become attack surfaces for **seizure** or **reinterpretation**.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúWe documented it, but didn‚Äôt explain the why‚Äù ‚Üí Missing justification collapses the semantic authority.
- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in a PDF, but not in the system‚Äù ‚Üí Off-system records do not preserve traceability and are not authoritative.

### üîÅ Variants

- `documentation.semantic`: The descriptive structure that justifies **why** a term has a particular meaning and how it **connects to others**.

- `documentation.legal`: Contracts, statutes, or public records that justify the **application of authority** and define **enforceable boundaries**.

- `documentation.archival`: Historical and versioned records of **terms**, **laws**, or **events**, stored to preserve **continuity** and resist tampering.

- `documentation.technical`: Structured descriptions (e.g. via Markdown, YAML, or JSON) that allow human and machine agents to **parse and execute meaning**.

---

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Version Control Required**: Every meaningful entry must include **timestamped, persistent, and reversible logs** of change and authorship.

- **Markdown as Onboarding Layer**: Early-stage entries may use Markdown to lower participation barriers, but must still adhere to structural rules for inclusion.

- **Linked Justifications**: Each document should point to **supporting definitions** it builds upon or modifies, forming a **semantic graph**.

- **AI-Ready Formatting**: Documentation should be written with **structured fields** to allow reliable **AI parsing**, validation, and inference.
