# Term: domination

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Domination** is the condition or process by which one actor, system, or structure exerts **unilateral and sustained control** over others, **displacing reciprocity, consent, or autonomy**, and impairing **semantic, legal, or social symmetry**.

**Domain**: power structures, social contracts, epistemology, linguistics, jurisprudence  
**Forms**: domination (n), dominant (adj), dominate (v), dominative (adj)

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Unilateral Imposition**: Domination involves **rules, meanings, or outcomes imposed** without equitable input or challenge.

- **Persistence Over Time**: Not a one-time act, but a **condition** maintained through structure, language, law, or culture.

- **Obstructed Contestation**: It thrives where others **cannot object, revise, or refuse** without punishment or disqualification.

- **Semantic Capture**: One of its strongest forms is the **monopoly over meaning**, where a dominant group defines what is “normal,” “valid,” or “true.”

---

### 🚫 Exclusions

- **Domination ≠ Leadership**: Leadership can be **delegated, rotated, or revoked**; domination **denies such mechanics**.

- **Domination ≠ Power Use**: Not all use of power is domination—only when it **sustains imbalance and disables self-governance**.

- **Domination ≠ Conflict**: Conflict may be mutual; domination requires **one-sided structural subordination**.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `domination.semantic`: When one language, dialect, or ideology **frames, limits, or reinterprets** all other inputs.

- `domination.institutional`: Organizations that **deny equal access or accountability**, shielding decisions from collective influence.

- `domination.legal`: Laws or procedures designed or applied to **reinforce control by specific classes** while masking legitimacy.

- `domination.technocratic`: When access to decision-making is filtered through **exclusive expertise**, even when not democratically consented.

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

**Extreme**, as domination **often disguises itself** in benevolent, rational, or even “fair” terminology.

- **Semantic Normalization**: Repetitive use of "standard" language or rules that **erase dissent or variation**.

- **Path Dependency**: Systems built on past domination **inherit and reinforce** power biases.

- **Double Standards**: Dominant actors can **shift definitions, rules, or principles** for strategic gain, while holding others to fixed interpretations.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Expose Unilateralism**: Identify where one actor's actions or meanings **cannot be reversed, appealed, or revised**.

- **Balance via Counterweight**: Systems should include **mechanisms of refusal, challenge, and decentralized revision**.

- **Semantic Diversity Protection**: Prevent one group from **monopolizing meaning or framing**.

- **Legitimacy Tests**: Require continual revalidation of authority to act—**nonrenewable authority is domination in slow motion**.

---

### 🌍 Why This Matters in Practice

- **Language as Weapon**: Domination over definitions controls **what can be said, imagined, or contested**.

- **Law Without Balance**: Legal domination occurs when courts or constitutions cannot be accessed, amended, or questioned by the affected.

- **AI and Governance**: If datasets or models are built from **dominated knowledge systems**, they will **reproduce and reinforce** those conditions.

- **Institutional Longevity ≠ Legitimacy**: Long-standing systems may **appear stable** while functioning through deep domination.

### ⚙️ In Logotecture

- **Track Power Structures**: Lexical entries must declare whether and how they **support or disrupt domination**.

- **Forks as Resistance**: Alternate definitions, etymologies, or structures may emerge to **escape dominance**—this is expected and encouraged.

- **Decentralized Input**: Authority over the dictionary must be **distributed, challengeable, and transparent** to avoid silent domination.

- **Validate Plural Truths**: Enable more than one valid framing of a term if domination blocks semantic diversity.
