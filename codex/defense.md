### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Protection Against Threats**: Defense involves taking measures to protect against potential or **actual threats**, ensuring that systems or entities remain **functional**, **secure**, and **stable**.

- **Resilience Building**: Defense is not only reactive but also proactive—creating **resilient structures** that can withstand challenges and adapt to changing circumstances or threats.

- **Preservation of Integrity**: The goal of defense is to preserve the **authenticity** and **integrity** of the system, knowledge, or entities being defended, ensuring that they remain **true to their origins** and **unaltered** by external influences.

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Offensive Actions**: Defense is not about **offensive** actions that seek to harm or disrupt others unnecessarily. Defense should be about **protection**, not **aggression**.

- **Over-Defensive Measures**: Over-protection or unnecessary defense mechanisms can create **barricades** or **restrictions** that hinder progress or prevent necessary engagement, reducing the **efficiency** and **functionality** of the system.

- **Complacency**: A defensive system that does not adapt to new threats or **situations** can become complacent and ineffective, rendering it unable to respond to evolving challenges.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Medium-High.  
- **Defense systems** can be **manipulated** or bypassed by those who know how to exploit vulnerabilities, including internal loopholes or weaknesses that may **compromise security**.

Invalid examples:
- “Defense against all threats” → Without careful **prioritization** and analysis, attempting to defend against every threat can lead to **ineffective** or **excessive** responses that waste resources.
- “No need for defense systems” → A stance that disregards the need for protection may leave systems or entities open to **malicious manipulation** or **corruption**.
