# Term: consistency

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Consistency** is the property of a system, structure, or concept whereby all of its components, outputs, and interpretations align without contradiction across time, context, and application. It reflects **uniform behavior**, **predictable meaning**, and **stable logic**. In Logotecture, consistency is essential for building **semantic integrity**, **legal fairness**, and **machine-parseable reliability**.

**Domain**: logic, semantics, systems theory, governance, mathematics, linguistics  
**Forms**: consistency (noun), consistent (adj), to consist (etymological root), inconsistent (antonym)

**Depends on**:  
- **integrity@1.0.0**  
- **truth@1.0.0**  
- **functionality@1.0.0**  
- **structure@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Non-Contradiction**: The system does not produce **conflicting outputs** or meanings under the same conditions.

- **Predictable Application**: Given the same input, the result is **reliable**. This makes interpretation, automation, and trust possible.

- **Semantic Uniformity**: A term, clause, or protocol must **retain its meaning** across time and usage unless explicitly updated.

- **Logical Soundness**: All internal logic steps **follow coherently** from premises to conclusions—mathematically or linguistically.

- **Temporal Stability**: Consistency demands that a system's rules or definitions do **not drift arbitrarily** unless deliberate and justified.

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Situational Contradictions**: Rules or terms that shift meaning or behavior based on **who applies them** or **who is affected** are not consistent.

- **Multiple Definitions Without Resolution**: Polysemy or ambiguous usage that lacks structured disambiguation undermines consistency.

- **Historical Drift Without Trace**: Changes in usage or structure that are not documented or justified break consistency.

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Institutions often **claim consistency** by appealing to tradition or continuity, even while changing how they operate or interpret core terms.

Invalid examples:
- “The law is consistently applied.” → If enforcement varies based on wealth or race, **apparent procedural uniformity** is not true consistency.
- “This term means the same everywhere.” → If it's used metaphorically in one clause and technically in another, **semantic inconsistency** has emerged.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `consistency.logical`: Adherence to deductive or algorithmic rules—statements do not contradict one another.

- `consistency.semantic`: Terms are used with the same definition and role throughout a text, protocol, or framework.

- `consistency.behavioral`: Systems or agents perform **similarly under similar conditions**, regardless of subjective bias.

- `consistency.temporal`: A rule or structure remains valid across **iterations, cycles, and generations**, unless explicitly revised.

- `consistency.relational`: Consistency between interacting systems (e.g., contract ↔ enforcement, law ↔ judiciary) ensures **systemic trust**.

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Consistent Definitions Are Foundational**: All key terms must be defined once and used **without deviation**, unless formally versioned and traceable.

- **Machine-Legibility**: For AI parsing and automated reasoning, **consistency is a precondition**—contradictions create failure points.

- **Consistency ≠ Rigidity**: Logotecture supports **adaptive revision**, but only when traceable, justified, and version-controlled. Controlled evolution ≠ inconsistency.

- **Enforcement Requires Consistency**: If rules are not applied consistently, they lose moral and legal **force**, even if codified.
