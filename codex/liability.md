### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Traceable Responsibility**: Liability must be directly **traceable** to an action or inaction that caused harm or violation  
- **Enforceable Consequences**: Liability demands **defined consequences** that are enforceable within a given system  
- **Scope of Action**: Liability is scoped to actions that **directly impact** or **fail to meet** obligations and duties within that system  
- **Auditable**: All liabilities must be documented and verifiable through **system logs** or **audit trails**

---

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Vague claims of liability** without **clear action/inaction** or **traceable harm**  
- **Moral or philosophical liability** (e.g. “social liability”) without **legal or contractual grounding**  
- **Responsibility** for actions outside the **system** where liability is defined (e.g. personal, informal actions)

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

Moderate — Liability is often misused to impose **unwarranted consequences** or **shift blame** without the proper evidence or scope.

Invalid examples:
- “You’re liable for everything bad that happens” → requires **defined harm** and **systemic obligation**  
- “She’s liable for their actions” → must show **direct causality** between actions and outcome  
- “Liability should fall on the victim for not preventing the harm” → ignores **systemic responsibility**

### 🔁 Variants

- `liability.contractual`: liability derived from a breach of contractual obligations  
- `liability.legal`: statutory or legally defined liability arising from a violation of law  
- `liability.systemic`: arising from structural failure or violation within a system  
- `liability.vicarious`: holding one party responsible for the actions of another (e.g. employer-employee)

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- Liability is **not** automatic — it must be **determined** through **proof** of breach, harm, and enforceability  
- Systems must define and **audit liability** regularly, ensuring that **no agent or entity** escapes responsibility without proper remediation  
- **Mitigation of liability** may occur where preventive measures were taken and proven to be **reasonable** under defined conditions
