# Term: rationality

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Rationality** is the capacity or condition of applying **logic, evidence, and consistent inference** to arrive at conclusions or decisions that **cohere with declared principles, available data, and functional outcomes**. In Logotecture, rationality is **not cold reasoning** but rather **semantic and systemic fidelity**‚Äîthinking and acting in ways that respect **truth, traceability, and coherence**.

**Domain**: epistemology, ethics, law, systems engineering, AI, governance  
**Forms**: rationality (noun), rational (adj), rationalize (verb), irrational (antonym)

**Depends on**:

- **consistency@1.0.0**

- **logic@1.0.0**

### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Logical Structure**: Arguments or actions follow internally valid steps‚Äî**no contradictions or arbitrary leaps**.

- **Evidence Responsiveness**: Rational systems update or revise beliefs and procedures **when faced with better information**.

- **Coherence Over Preference**: Choices are grounded in **reasoned justification**, not mere feeling or bias.

- **Transparency of Thought**: The reasoning behind a decision can be **explained, traced, and reconstructed**.

- **Consistency Across Domains**: Rational principles apply **regardless of who is involved or what is at stake**.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Emotionless Thinking**: Rationality does not mean **absence of emotion**‚Äîit means **emotions are recognized and integrated properly**, not ignored or inflated.

- **Technocratic Bias**: Not all complex systems are rational. Rationality includes **interpretability**, not just optimization.

- **Majority Rule**: Rationality is not the same as popularity. Widely held but **unjustified beliefs can still be irrational**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Rationality is often **used as a claim of superiority**, especially to dismiss emotional, spiritual, or indigenous ways of knowing.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs irrational‚Äù ‚Üí If not followed by analysis or justification, this is a **dismissal**, not a diagnosis.
- ‚ÄúWe chose the rational path‚Äù ‚Üí If hidden interests shaped the outcome, then it is **performative rationality**, not actual.

### üîÅ Variants

- `rationality.semantic`: Word choices and term logic are **internally consistent and reference-aligned**.

- `rationality.judicial`: Decisions in legal contexts follow **explicit logic paths**, not arbitrary traditions or emotional reactions.

- `rationality.systemic`: A structure or process produces outcomes aligned with declared goals, **traceable rules**, and ethical bounds.

- `rationality.collective`: Group decisions are **informed, open to revision, and defensible across perspectives**.

- `rationality.artificial`: AI or algorithmic processes operate under **auditable logic rules** and can be corrected or questioned.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Rationality ‚â† Authority**: The mere claim of being rational does not **validate power**‚Äîonly **auditable logic paths** do.

- **Design for Transparent Rationality**: If a decision system cannot **show how it thinks**, it is not rational, no matter the outcome.

- **Challenge Welcomed**: A rational system must be **designed to accept and survive good-faith critique**.
