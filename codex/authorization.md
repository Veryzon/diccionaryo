### üîç Core Characteristics

- **Permission Granting**: Authorization is the act of formally granting access to **resources**, **actions**, or **systems**, establishing a **clear boundary** for who can perform what tasks.

- **Access Control**: It involves regulating who can access or alter information, perform activities, or interact with **systems** based on **predefined criteria** such as **role**, **need**, or **entitlement**.

- **Legitimacy and Rights**: Authorization is tied to the principle of **legitimate access**‚Äîonly individuals or entities with **legitimate rights** or **entitlements** are granted access, thus preventing abuse or unauthorized behavior.

- **Revocation and Modification**: Authorization is not permanent‚Äî**permissions** can be revoked or modified based on **changing circumstances**, needs, or actions taken by the **authorized entity**.

- **Ethical Boundaries**: Authorization must align with ethical principles, ensuring that granted permissions do not violate **autonomy**, **privacy**, or other fundamental rights.

### üöß Exclusions

- **Unauthorized Access**: Any act of gaining access to systems, information, or resources without proper **authorization** is considered an **abuse of power** and undermines system integrity.

- **Over-Authorization**: Granting excessive permissions to entities without appropriate checks or balances, leading to potential **misuse** or **exploitation**.

- **Manipulation of Authorization**: **Misleading claims** or **false representations** of authorized actions or permissions undermine the validity and reliability of the system and could lead to **illegitimate actions**.

### üí£ Sideloading Risk

High.  
- Authorization is highly vulnerable to **manipulation** or **circumvention**, especially in contexts where **powers** or **privileges** can be **misappropriated** by those with **undue influence**.

Invalid examples:
- ‚ÄúI authorize myself‚Äù ‚Üí If **authorization** is not backed by a legitimate **process** or **system**, it becomes invalid and manipulative.
- ‚ÄúUnauthorized access is justified‚Äù ‚Üí If permission is bypassed for personal or political reasons, it creates serious risks to the integrity and security of the system.

### üîê Governance Notes

- **Revocation of Authority**: Systems should have mechanisms to **revoke** or **restrict** authorization when an entity no longer meets the conditions for access or when it is found to be abusing its rights.

- **Prevention of Overreach**: Authorization should have **clearly defined limits** to ensure that it doesn‚Äôt extend beyond its **original intent** or infringe on **rights** or **autonomy** of other entities.
