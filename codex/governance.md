### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Structure and Oversight**: Governance involves the **design of structures** and **systems of oversight** that ensure responsible decision-making and actions are in line with collective goals.
- **Inclusive Decision-Making**: It is characterized by an inclusive process, ensuring that diverse stakeholders are represented, heard, and considered when decisions are made.
- **Accountability and Legitimacy**: Governance structures must be **accountable**, and their decisions must be **legitimate** to ensure that authority is not abused and that actions are properly justified.
- **Sustainability and Equity**: Governance should aim to produce long-term, **sustainable** outcomes that are fair and equitable for all involved parties.

### 🚧 Exclusions

- **Corruption**: Governance cannot be effective if it is **compromised** by corruption, where decisions are made based on personal gain or **unjust interests**.  
- **Autocratic rule**: Governance that is **centralized** and lacks **checks and balances** undermines fairness and accountability, making it **less effective** and potentially harmful.
- **Opaque decision-making**: Governance requires **transparency**; decisions made in secrecy or without clear reasoning create mistrust and undermine **legitimacy**.

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

High.  
- **Governance** systems are vulnerable to being hijacked by powerful entities that manipulate structures for their own benefit. Governance systems can be **reinterpreted** or **sideloaded** to serve narrow interests if **proper checks** and **balance mechanisms** are not in place.

Invalid examples:
- “The government has a **governance structure**, but it doesn’t involve citizens in key decisions” → governance needs **inclusive participation**, not just **top-down** decision-making  
- “We have a governance model, but it is constantly changed behind closed doors” → governance requires **transparency**, not secretive decision-making  
- “The organization is governed by a single person without any external oversight” → **diverse oversight** is necessary for legitimate governance, not just a **single voice**.
