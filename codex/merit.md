# Term: merit

## v1.0.0

**Definition**  
**Merit** is the **demonstrated alignment** between an agent’s performance, behavior, or output and a **declared, verifiable set of criteria** that define **value, competence, or contribution** in a given context. In Logotecture, merit is **not assumed, inherited, or claimed**—it is **earned, contextualized**, and **traceable**.

**Domain**: ethics, institutional design, education, work systems, governance  
**Forms**: merit (noun), meritorious (adj), merit-based (adj phrase), demerit (inverse term)

**Depends on**:  
- **criteria@1.0.0**  
- **validation@1.0.0**  
- **justification@1.0.0**  
- **traceability@1.0.0**

### 🔍 Core Characteristics

- **Performance-Linked**: Merit arises from **observable actions, results, or behaviors**, not status, intention, or association.

- **Context-Specific**: What counts as merit in one domain (e.g. artistic) may not in another (e.g. legal or technical). Context must be **declared and bound**.

- **Criteria-Based**: Merit must be **assessed against previously stated, transparent criteria**, not post-facto expectations.

- **Non-Inheritable**: Merit **cannot be passed down, transferred, or socially projected**—it is bound to the agent's own record.

---

### 🚫 Exclusions

- **Merit ≠ Privilege**: Privilege is granted or inherited; merit is **earned by demonstrable alignment to criteria**.

- **Merit ≠ Popularity**: Social acceptance or trend status does not constitute merit unless defined as such in evaluative criteria.

- **Merit ≠ Effort Alone**: While effort can contribute, merit in Logotecture **requires results aligned with declared goals**.

---

### 💣 Sideloading Risk

**Very High**.  
Merit is often **politically or culturally hijacked** to justify inequality or to disguise privilege. Logotecture requires that merit be **fully defined by system-declared metrics** and **not vaguely invoked**.

Examples:
- Awarding positions to insiders under a vague “merit” banner with no performance criteria.
- Using "meritocracy" to exclude groups structurally denied access to proving grounds.
- Repackaging dominance or conformity as merit via biased definitions of excellence.

---

### 🔁 Variants

- `merit.technical`: Based on skill, precision, or contribution to functionality.

- `merit.ethical`: Based on contribution to collective well-being, integrity, or fairness.

- `merit.institutional`: Based on sustained and visible impact aligned with organizational goals.

- `merit.symbolic`: Evaluated for representational or cultural resonance (must still follow criteria).

---

### 🔐 Governance Notes

- **Declare Merit Criteria Before Use**: All uses of merit must be **bound to a visible criteria set**.

- **Merit Must Be Verifiable**: Claims of merit must be **traceable to evidence**, including outputs or effects.

- **Avoid Merit Drift**: Systems must resist altering criteria post-assessment to retrofit outcomes.

- **Separate Reward from Justification**: Rewarding merit is a policy decision—**merit itself is evaluative**, not normative.

---

### 🌍 Why This Matters in Practice

- Merit can be used to **inspire fairness**, but also to **justify exclusion, exploitation, or reward loops**.  
- In Logotecture, it must be **provable, bounded, and contextual**—never mythologized or used as rhetorical camouflage.  
- AI systems and legal agents must treat merit as a **function of structure**, not impression.
